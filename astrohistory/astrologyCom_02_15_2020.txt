<p><span class="date">Feb 15, 2020:</span> Not every day can be a great day, as these next 24 hours may prove to you. Aside from an overall lack of pizzazz in your environs, there may not be much development in any of your projects. But one dud of a day doesn't have to get your down. After all, variety is the spice of life, and not every spice is sweet. Treat this day as simmer time on a stew that will eventually be quite delicious. Be patient and trust that when things are meant to be, they'll be.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 15, 2020:</span> Today's energy is focused on completion. As things get wrapped up, you'll discover that your upcoming social calendar has a lot of holes in it, but do not fill them up! Leave as many blanks as possible, then you can call up a friend who's been waiting for a date. While you're at it, get back in touch with a family member who needs an update on how you've been. It's more important to keep up the connections with the people you love. They are ultimately your rock.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 15, 2020:</span> Your relationships are not all exclusive. Sometimes, like it or not, you have to share the people you love. You should have plenty of confidence in the value you bring to your closest friends, and don't worry that anyone else can change that personal connection. If you get too possessive about your relationship, you send a message that the assurance you need is more important than the other person's independence. It's a clear power play, and it won't be well received.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 15, 2020:</span> Your energy is extremely attractive today. You're like a flame that attracts many moths. The attention is wonderful and invigorating, but take another look at this cadre of fluttering fawners for just a moment. You will soon realize that their adoration isn't built on a very substantial foundation. It's not that you don't deserve diehard fans, it's just that the people singing your praises may not be the kind of people you need to be impressing. Aim higher.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 15, 2020:</span> If someone is pushing you toward taking a certain action right now, it's in your best interests to push right back. There's no need to make a big issue about it. Just firmly state that you're going to follow your own plans, and that's that. Your power is your own, so don't be too eager to give it up. Even if you're in a tough spot and looking for someone else to take over the difficult decisions, you have to handle everything on your own right now.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 15, 2020:</span> Clarity is something you should never, ever take for granted. Today, when you instantly understand all the complicated ideas that are being bandied about, celebrate that sensation by pushing the conversation into even deeper territory. Confusion is simply not possible for you today, although the folks around you might be left scratching their heads. Be ready to help explain ideas to folks who might not have the patience and perspective you have about things.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 15, 2020:</span> There is a huge risk of overreaction today, either on your part or on the part of the people you're talking to. You can't anticipate how other people will react, so don't try to censor yourself in anticipation of a blowout. You'll only end up confusing yourself and diluting your message. It's a much better strategy to carry on as you normally would, and deal with any emotional outbursts as they come. Roll with the punches and you might even have fun coming up with a solution.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 15, 2020:</span> Be ready to have your regular routine turned on its ear. There's a storm brewing, and things may not go to go as planned. Fortunately, you'll be delighted by the unexpected outcome. Stick with your current projects and be patient if they veer off track a bit today. Be flexible, and you'll gain new appreciation for the smaller things in life. Suddenly, beauty will be all around you, and you could even realize you have the best friends and family in the world.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 15, 2020:</span> It may be slow going at the start of the day, but don't get discouraged too easily. The people around you have some excellent ideas to share with you, and they will be looking to you to put the finishing touches on things. It's collaboration that will give you the energy you need, not going out on your own. Stick close to controversial folks who always get a reaction. They may inspire you to take more risks. You're entering a very lucky phase, so taking a risk could pay off well.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 15, 2020:</span> Your intellectual strengths can feel like a curse when they serve to intimidate lesser minds and make them feel unworthy. But today your brains will be an out and out blessing, helping you make good connections with people from several different walks of life. You're going to be exposed to an avalanche of new ideas, and some of them might be confusing. This mental challenge feels new for you, but it's something you need in order to stay sharp and engaged with the world.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 15, 2020:</span> Hold off making any major travel plans today. It's fine to narrow down your options or even finalize your itinerary, but you should definitely not sign any paperwork or make any deposits. There is a high degree of uncertainty with one element of your trip, and some information could soon come to light that causes you to make some modifications. Don't forget to take some time to organize your life well enough so that it can go on without you while you're traveling.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 15, 2020:</span> The day could have its share of drama, but luckily it will all be more of the spilled-coffee variety and not anything more serious. These petty issues will all have obvious solutions, but they still may take up a fair bit of your energy. To get away from all the hassles that may haunt you right now, try to get some time by yourself. People around you are getting closer to crisis mode and their anxiety could rub off on you. Quiet time alone will keep you calm.</p>
