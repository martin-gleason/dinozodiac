<p><span class="date">Feb 13, 2020:</span> Don't act too rashly today. Your impulsive side lacks an accurate perspective on what's going on right now. If you follow your impulses today, you could regret it tomorrow. Today is a day for you to stick with things and see them through. Keep your focus limited to one or two projects, and try not to get distracted by other people's drama. There is nothing urgent enough going on right now that deserves to take your attention away from what you're working on.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 13, 2020:</span> Do you feel like you have innovative and important new ideas that no one is listening to? You should realize that you can't wait for other people to stop and hear out what you have to say. Sometimes you just have to walk right up to the people you want to impress and make them hear you. You will knock their socks off! Don't worry about coming off as arrogant or rude. Remember, it's much easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 13, 2020:</span> It's very important for you to be around opinionated people every once in a while. Not only does it help exercise your verbal sparring skills, but it also helps keep you on your toes. It reminds you that not everyone agrees with you all the time. You need to seek out people who feel differently than you today. Start up some discussions, keep things light and friendly, and you will be able to learn a lot about the strength of your convictions and how you come to your conclusions.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 13, 2020:</span> Being honorable is something you should do for its own sake, not just for the sake of showing how selfless you are. There's no point in helping others if your true goal is to promote yourself. But there's nothing wrong with helping yourself. Just make sure you're up front and honest about your motivations. Everyone will respect you a lot more if you avoid coming off as self-righteous and instead just seem like an honest person who's trying to improve.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 13, 2020:</span> Someone you care about could be headed for a better future, and news of the imminent departure could cause you to suddenly realize that you care about them more than you realized. This is a sad case of "too little too late," and as much as you'd like to wear your heart on your sleeve and share everything you feel with them, this is wouldn't be wise now. Take this as a lesson for the future: When you are interested in someone, get to know them. Don't assume that they'll always be around.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 13, 2020:</span> If there has ever been a perfect time to stop and take stock of your situation, it's now. A lot has been going on in your life, and you really haven't given yourself enough time to get used to the changes that have been happening, and it's important that you do as soon as possible. Not everything is as it seems. The faster you can adjust to the realities, the faster you will able to grab a new opportunity that's hovering just outside of your universe right now.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 13, 2020:</span> If your boss is becoming a major problem in the workplace, you'll have to step up and be the voice of leadership soon. What? Do you think that you aren't up for the challenge? Come on! You've been more of a leader to many of your co-workers than the big boss has been for quite a while, so just keep doing what you're doing and don't think too much about how it will look to others. If you do, you'll just end up getting stressed.</p>

There should be many opportunities to expand your social circle right now, and if you're feeling ready for some engaging small talk, you'll get more than your share.

All the pieces are going to fall together perfectly, and you'll be able to plan a big celebration soon. You get to completely enjoy your day while other people are overwhelmed by drama.

<p><span class="date">Feb 13, 2020:</span> If you can set aside any insecurities, you should be able to turn an ordinary meeting into an extraordinary encounter. All it takes is saying what you feel and not being afraid of how the other people might react. The key is to keep your thoughts on a high level. Think about announcing headlines instead of getting down into the nitty-gritty details. No one wants to know the intricacies of why you feel the way you feel, but they do want to know what you feel.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 13, 2020:</span> You have a lot confidence in your ideas, and that confidence is well founded, but that doesn't mean that everyone else needs to know all the ins and outs of what you believe! Don't get carried away about what you think about current events, and don't inflict your opinions on others right now. Your opinions are valid, but everyone has valid opinions, and many of them may clash with yours. Stay open to compromise. A fiercely dogmatic outlook could send the wrong message.</p>
