<p><span class="date">Mar 17, 2020:</span> There's no need to keep worrying about a conversation that you have to have. All you need to do is look the other person square in the eye and everything will be fine. Your image matters, and you need to be mindful of how you come across to the other person. Look calm, confident, and correct. What you say isn't nearly as important as how you say it, so spend more time preparing your demeanor, and make sure you're dressed appropriately.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 17, 2020:</span> Generosity is a major part of who you are, and it's something you should always value and cultivate. But resist the urge to help out one of your co-workers now. You could get involved in something that is a lot more complicated and risky than you realize. If you extend yourself too much right now, you may run into some political problems. Your energy isn't as endless as you think, and if you run out of steam, you're no good to anyone. Keep to yourself for now.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 17, 2020:</span> You could be one impressive mastermind today, coming up with a lot of ideas and starting a lot of new projects—that someone else can finish. In order to keep yourself as valuable as possible, concentrate on creating new images, concepts, and written words. Then step out of the process and delegate the rest of the job to people who are looking for new responsibilities. You can't micromanage every aspect of the day, but you can make sure that things at least get started in the right way.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 17, 2020:</span> If you've been enjoying a long period of domestic bliss, be prepared for something of a hiccup. Tight schedules, unexpected visitors, inflexible people, or some short-tempered relatives could toss a ticking time bomb into your peaceful home life. Luckily, you'll be able to defuse it quickly and easily. Of course, you might have to be the one to bend over backward more than anyone else, but you won't mind too much. It's all for the best.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 17, 2020:</span> You might have to make an important decision about a friendship. It likely involves an imbalance: Someone is working harder than someone else; that is, one of you isn't putting forth enough effort, and the other one needs a stronger commitment. You could be either person in this scenario, but no matter what, you need to be completely honest about what you need and what you're willing to give. If you keep telling them what you think they want to hear, you're wasting time.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 17, 2020:</span> A unique person could make quite an impression in your world. They could emerge in a public place, and you won't be the only person confused by what they're talking about. Don't assign too much significance to their odd ways. Chances are they just want some attention. They aren't saying or doing anything of great importance. When the volume is turned up, the value is often low.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 17, 2020:</span> There's nothing quite like a healthy dose of attention to boost your mood! Keep your eyes open and you could catch some admiring glances directed at you. There's a strong current of flirtatiousness around you, so don't be surprised if you're approached by a smiling stranger. Be careful not to get too friendly, though, or you might send out the wrong (overly encouraging) message! Crowded areas could also give you lots of energy, so spend time in a busy public space if possible.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 17, 2020:</span> Someone who has been elusive in the past is suddenly making themselves available to you. In fact, they might even start making a bit of a nuisance of themselves! What could explain their sudden change of attitude toward you? They've been listening to what other people have been saying about you, and they like what they've been hearing. Their sudden attention might be driven by curiosity more than anything else, so don't make assumptions.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 17, 2020:</span> Belonging to a group is very important to you right now. The team dynamic can buoy you up if you get in a funk and inspire you when you need some fresh thinking. See if you can align yourself with two or three people who are looking for someone to round out their group. Communication is good today, so you should have no trouble charming your way aboard their ship. Together, you could set sail for rewarding adventures.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 17, 2020:</span> Challenges help shape who you are, and it's unwise to avoid them for too long. From time to time, it's okay to pass on a risky-sounding opportunity. But right now you might want to take advantage of any opportunities you can find—and the tougher they sound the better. Maybe this means you need to join a gym, or maybe it means you need to hook up with a personal trainer to supercharge your workout. Turning up the heat on yourself can help you rise to the occasion.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 17, 2020:</span> Have you ever heard the expression "kill them with kindness"? Today you can apply it to anyone who gets on the wrong side of your temper. Instead of force-feeding them a piece of your mind and then marching off in a huff, connect with them. Smile at them. Find out what they're really trying to say, and then address the content of their remarks. By showing them so much respect, you'll effectively point out to them that they weren't doing the same for you.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 17, 2020:</span> Your urge to clean could be strong today. It's out with the old and in with the new for you right now, and that applies to more than just what's in your closet. After you've gotten rid of the garbage you don't need in your life any more, think about ridding yourself of the negative people you don't need in your life any more. Stop going to that cranky cashier. Say "no, thanks" when that catty co-worker asks you to lunch. Stick with newer, brighter attitudes.</p>
