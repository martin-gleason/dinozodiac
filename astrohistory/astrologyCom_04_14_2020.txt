<p><span class="date">Apr 14, 2020:</span> Something you've felt lurking just under the surface could start to reveal itself today, and the resulting emotional shift could make your day a confusing one. Therefore, try not to make any big commitments or sign any legal documents. For a little while, at least, you'll have to take a "wait and see" attitude to a few things. What you need to do in your life may not be extremely clear right now, but you'll have to learn how to be comfortable with that.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 14, 2020:</span> Buckle up and get ready for a storm to hit today. There's a strong wave of confusion and resentment coming, and you might be right in its path. You won't be victimized by this angry energy, but your life could be affected a bit. Everyone's emotions are high right now, and you might lose your temper, too, but it's to be expected. Ride this wave of unpredictability for as long as it takes. You'll come out on the other side with a few lessons under your belt.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 14, 2020:</span> Many different people are pushing you for action right now, and it might be in your best interests to make them happy. They aren't as concerned with the quality of your actions as they are with you just doing something now, so there's no reason to put any pressure on yourself. There is no wrong answer here, so anything you do will be appreciated. This is a no-lose situation for you, so let go of the tension you may be feeling and just go for it!</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 14, 2020:</span> It isn't hard to feel good when you have great people in your court supporting every step you take. Rally your dearest friends today and have a virtual party. Remind yourself of how lucky you are to have these people in your life. Doing so will enable all these people to realize how lucky they are to know you! Don't concern yourself with solving major problems or disputes today. Just live and let live.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 14, 2020:</span> Just because you don't agree with a certain someone doesn't mean that you can't get along with them. If you opted out of being friends with people who think about life differently, you'd have a very boring social life. The yin and yang of this relationship creates an exciting intellectual reward, and all the debate can be fun. You have so much more to offer than just your congeniality, and people are just as attracted to your rough edges as they are to your smooth ways.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 14, 2020:</span> From time to time, a reminder of where you've come from is a helpful way to stay on the right path. Today, you could encounter some familiar conflicts, but this time, instead of sending you into a panic, they will be easy to ignore. They're vestigial reminders of a former you. When was the last time you truly recognized how you've grown? Take an hour or so today to flip through a photo album, read old diary entries, or just think about past adventures.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 14, 2020:</span> It's time to focus some energy on your social life. You've missed many opportunities to see great plays, bands, or long-lost friends. But you can still schedule dates for the future. Whether it's with someone you see often or a brand-new crush doesn't matterâ€”make some plans! You need to show the universe that you will get through this period. Don't take this part of your life for granted.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 14, 2020:</span> Prep work may not be your favorite thing to do, but today your time will be well spent planning and doing things like drawing up blueprints, booking travel dates, researching celebration locations, or putting together a guest list. An idea for an unusual combination will spark your creativity and get the wheels turning toward a possible love match or career connection. You could be the catalyst for a lot of positive changes in the future, so keep all your social contacts healthy.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 14, 2020:</span> The pace of today could be fast, but you'll love every minute of it. For a while now, you've been itching for the people around you to pick up the pace, and you'll definitely get your wish now. You could be in the middle of the action, playing conductor to a mad bunch of musicians who don't always follow your lead. Humor will be a useful tool for getting what you want from people who don't want to appear to be under your thumb. Reverse psychology works wonders with a younger friend.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 14, 2020:</span> Get ready to build a much closer relationship with someone who holds a great deal of authority in your life right now. You'll be spending more time collaborating, and you'll be expected to act more as a coequal than an underling. Try not to get intimidated by their somewhat chilly demeanor. Focus on getting your ideas across, not on charming them. That will come much more naturally later. Work for their respect, not for a laugh or a smile.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 14, 2020:</span> The intellectual in you will see many interesting facets to the day and be intrigued by every one of them. Everything you encounter could be confusing as well as fascinating. You will want to dissect and interpret everything you survey, and this curiosity will serve you well. It may even lead to a new financial opportunity. It's been a very long time since you fed your brain just for the sake of learning something. It would be good to get back in the habit.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 14, 2020:</span> You might spy a great bargain on something you've been saving up for, but don't be in a hurry buy it. You still owe it to yourself to shop around. After all, if one retailer is slashing prices, doesn't it stand to reason that others will, too? Reacting too quickly to any good-sounding news isn't wise today. Take in the information, but don't shape your life around it. You would be much wiser to wait until the dust settles and you know for sure.</p>
