<p><span class="date">Mar 18, 2020:</span> There could be a lot of emotions swirling around you today. It might seem like every time you walk into a room, someone is laughing, crying, or arguing. Your job is to try to stay as objective as possible in each situation. Be supportive of your friends, but don't get too involved in the melodrama that could be unfolding in front of you. If you do, you could lose your balance and get distracted away from important goals you're working toward.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 18, 2020:</span> The game you've been playing is heating up, and you need to boost your competitiveness in order to stay in it. The good news is that you've got all the intensity you need to stay focused without losing your cool. Lean on a friend who has been acting as a cheerleader. They will give you the lift you need to keep your eye on the ball and stay positive. The outcome is still uncertain, but you can turn things in a favorable direction if you unleash your hidden weapon: wit.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 18, 2020:</span> Paying more attention to your health today could make a big difference tomorrow. It's time to think more proactively about your physical being in order to avoid bigger problems down the road. If you just cut one thing out of your diet that you know is bad for you, you could notice a big difference in a matter of weeks. Your energy level is unpredictable right now, but if you can get more exercise, you can help keep yourself on more of an even keel.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 18, 2020:</span> An invitation could come your way out of the blue, and it will probably throw you for a loop. Figuring out whether or not to accept it shouldn't take long, but it might. You could be feeling very indecisive about everything right now, even with a no-brainer like this. Time is passing, and every moment you deliberate is a moment you'll never get back. So act quickly and go with your gut. You won't regret whatever happens.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 18, 2020:</span> If you know something is wrong in one of your relationships, why aren't you paying more attention to it? It doesn't take more time or energy to look at these issues deeply. It just takes more honesty. You might be afraid of what you find, but whether you find it or not, it's still there. Wouldn't you rather know what you're dealing with right now? Be brave and take a long, hard look at things. Chances are they're fixable. And once you fix them together, things will be stronger than ever.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 18, 2020:</span> If you're feeling bored or looking for an entertaining challenge, let your intellectually curious side steer you straight to stimulation. If you take time to go the long way, to see all the sights and explore all the nooks and crannies, you won't be disappointed. Familiar places will take on a special new significance, and you'll find something you thought you'd lost. Search the world with an open mind today, and every surprise you find will be a happy one.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 18, 2020:</span> Your eye for beauty is in clear, strong focus now. You're going to be drawn to things that celebrate beauty in every sense of the word. You'll appreciate the most luxurious aesthetics in fine food, visual art, music, and fashion, so if you're going shopping, you could run the risk of melting your credit card! One little splurge won't harm you, so enjoy the pleasant act of picking out that one lavish gift to give yourself. You deserve it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 18, 2020:</span> This is a very good time to make a clean sweep of things, whether that requires you to clean up a dirty room or clear up a touchy misunderstanding between you and a friend. A fresh start is possible if you put in the work. Roll up your sleeves and get going as early in the day as you can, because your intense energy won't last all day. As long as you have the energy for the task, you'll enjoy every minute of the effort.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 18, 2020:</span> There could be a realignment going on among your friends. Parts of your circle may be breaking off into smaller units. You might not be aware of the magnitude of all the reshuffling, but that's only because you probably won't be affected by it. Give these people the space and time they need to figure out why they need a new social focus. You definitely shouldn't get involved or pick sides. Maintain relationships with the people you want in your life. That's all you need to do.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 18, 2020:</span> How are your juggling skills? Things may be getting busier than ever, and it could get tricky trying to keep everyone happy. There just aren't enough hours in the day! Don't feel bad or guilty if you have to put long-term relationships or projects on the back burner for now. What's going on may be very time sensitive, and if you hesitate too long, you might miss out. Friends will understand if you have to beg off. Remember them when it comes time to celebrate your success.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 18, 2020:</span> You may not be able to shake off your deep feelings, no matter how many distractions come your way. What's on your mind isn't going to go away until you deal with it head-on. So you need to have that conversation, write that e-mail, ask for that raise, or do whatever other intimidating thing you're avoiding. The toughest move is the hardest one to make, but it's the one you need to make. You have the strength, so why are you even doubting yourself?</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 18, 2020:</span> Just because someone you care about likes people to get along doesn't mean they're a doormat! Don't worry about how a friend or loved one is handling a tense situation. You need to trust that they know what they're doing. Have faith in them, and they won't disappoint you. It wouldn't be wise to offer unsolicited advice. They could take it as a sign that you don't think they can handle things on their own. Just stand by and be there when or if they need you.</p>
