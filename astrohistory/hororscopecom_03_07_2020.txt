<p><strong>Mar 7, 2020</strong> - You may be on a slow, steady track of discipline that embraces an older, more traditional way of looking at things, Aries. Suddenly, however, you're hit by an aggressive force urging you to do things differently. The more you try to resist this force, the more it's apt to cause friction and tension. Open your arms and welcome this new energy that will have a very positive effect on you.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 7, 2020</strong> - A radical force seems to be stirring up trouble and challenging your long-established beliefs about how things should be done and what you hold most dear, Taurus. The truth is that what you might see as trouble is really a growing pain to be endured as you move to the next step in your personal evolution. Change is often difficult; however, this is what you're being called upon to do.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 7, 2020</strong> - Things could get a bit tense for you, Gemini. One of your first reactions might be to look to your loved ones for support. Unfortunately, you might find that your standbys aren't standing by. In fact, it could seem like they've joined the opposition. You might at first feel like you've been betrayed. In reality, maybe you're fighting for an old cause and it's time to join the opposition, too.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 7, 2020</strong> - Parts of your life might seem like gladiatorial games out of ancient Rome. The good news is that if anyone can rise above this situation and see the truth in the matter, it's you, Cancer. Be careful to not be too obstinate about how to resolve things. This is likely to get you deeper into a mess that you shouldn't have to deal with in the first place. Your job is to mediate not dictate.</p>

<h1>Leo Horoscope</h1>

<p><strong>Mar 7, 2020</strong> - You're apt to go in circles if you only see the negative side of every situation, Leo. Your lack of perspective could keep you from seeing an answer right in front of you. Your mind is your greatest asset and your worst enemy. Don't become a victim of its automatic bias toward the negative. Once you take control and start looking at the positive aspects, the answer will become clear.</p>

<h1>Virgo Horoscope</h1>

<p><strong>Mar 7, 2020</strong> - You're likely to be on a roll with new and innovative ideas about your goals in life, Virgo. Unfortunately, there are some obstacles. People who are scared of the new and different are apt to try to toss a monkey wrench into the spokes of your wheels. More than likely, these people are simply reacting out of fear of something they don't understand. Help them see your perspective.</p>

<h1>Libra Horoscope</h1>

<p><strong>Mar 7, 2020</strong> - Remember that even though there is tension and chaos all around, Libra, it doesn't have to affect you. Your motto should be you're "in it but not of it." The basis of most feuds boils down to the struggle between the old and the new. Try not to let their battles become yours. Learn from them by staying close enough to observe and understand but far enough away that you keep your hands clean.</p>

<h1>Scorpio Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=8


<p><strong>Mar 7, 2020</strong> - While your brain may want to charge ahead with new and revolutionary ideas, there is something holding you back from setting these ideas into motion, Scorpio. It could be that there is a small voice in your head telling you to slow down and not automatically accept things and adopt them into your life just because they're new. Do your best to strike a balance between these two viewpoints.</p>

<h1>Sagittarius Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=9


<p><strong>Mar 7, 2020</strong> - You could feel like you're walking a puppy that won't heel, Sagittarius. The puppy is curious and, at times, rather reckless. It doesn't know about the dangers of cars or a twisted leash. You have a great responsibility to teach this dog some lesson, while at the same time giving it a bit of freedom to go out and explore alone. Earn the respect of others by tempering discipline with fun.</p>

<h1>Capricorn Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=10


<p><strong>Mar 7, 2020</strong> - Your mental processes may run into a snag as you discover that there are certain rules and guidelines by which you need to abide, Capricorn. Sometimes you feel as if you're above all the rules, that you can establish your own based on your personal morals, and that everything will be fine. Unfortunately, you must sometimes obey others' rules. Try not to be upset by this; just deal with it.</p>

<h1>Aquarius Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=11


<p><strong>Mar 7, 2020</strong> - In all the time spent trying to stabilize your emotions and achieve sensitivity, you may get too caught up in your feelings, Aquarius. Because of this, you may have not been listening to your rational mind lately, even though it's crying out for you to move forward to a different situation. Take some time to listen to your thoughts and take them more seriously than you have been.</p>


12:
<h1>Pisces Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=12


<p><strong>Mar 7, 2020</strong> - The more you can apply to your own life the advice you give to others, the better off you'll be, Pisces. No one is going to follow a leader who doesn't abide by his or her own standards. If you're going to offer your guidance to someone else, make sure you're willing to operate by the same rules and accept feedback regarding their effectiveness.</p>
