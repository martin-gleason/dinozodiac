<p><span class="date">Feb 18, 2020:</span> Taking care of your health isn't something you can do only once in a while. It's something you have to integrate into your life every single day. The good news is that once you learn how to eat better and exercise more, it becomes easy to stick with it. Your self-discipline is stronger than ever, so you're in the best frame of mind to start a new fitness routine, join a gym, or invest in some new exercise equipment. It won't take much to get you hooked on feeling good.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 18, 2020:</span> What are your thoughts on the latest revelation from a friend? What? Don't you know?! Today, you need to figure it out. Sure, the drama of it has caught you a little bit off guard, but your quick thinking needs to kick in right now. Don't let your reactions be guided too much by your fears. Give things time to sink in, and you'll come to a conclusion about how you feel. They really care about your honesty, so be ready to deliver them the good or bad news with compassion.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 18, 2020:</span> If your attention is being divided between your home life and your public life, the best choice is to focus more on the issues that are going on around your home. Why? Because your home is your refuge, a safe foundation, and you need to keep it that way. Everything from household squabbles to a broken faucet could be causing you stress right now, so attend to all of them and make sure that you can leave your home every day knowing that you'll return to peace and calm.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 18, 2020:</span> It's a good day to invest in the resources that help you get things done in your life. If you need to buy computer equipment, tools, office supplies, or even just a more comfortable pair of shoes, today is the day to do it. If you shop around a bit, you'll find some great bargains. Don't worry that you're wasting your money. From time to time, you have to invest in things now that will help you earn more tomorrow.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 18, 2020:</span> If you're in the early stages of a romance, don't worry if the conversations you have with your partner aren't exactly deep and meaningful. As you get to know each other better, the realities of the world start to take over, and talking about your feelings isn't always possible or practical. Don't focus on the fact that you don't know exactly what they're thinking now. Focus instead on the fact that they're integrating you into their everyday life.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 18, 2020:</span> Balance is important today. Before making any type of decision, you have to weigh the pros and cons of each possible course of action. Don't put things off for another day because you'll have too much to deal with later. You can't understand the right way to move forward until you examine these situations more thoroughly. Giving up what you want in an effort to compromise should not be your automatic reaction.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 18, 2020:</span> If waiting for the other person to make the first move makes you feel too passive today, then grab the power back! If you want things to move forward, take the first step and see if they follow you. If they do, then you both can get started on the new phase of your relationship right away. If they don't follow you, then you know where you stand, and you won't waste any more of your precious time. Instead of being afraid of rejection, it's time to take a risk and step right up to it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 18, 2020:</span> If you're feeling unsure in a new situation today, you can always turn to the people you love for advice and insight. They're much more aware of the big picture than you are. Right now, you're a bit too far into your own head to be able to step back and get the perspective you need. Relying on loved ones is important to do from time to time, even when you're working on something personal. Trust the viewpoint of someone who knows you well.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 18, 2020:</span> You can reach an important compromise with an authority figure. It's all about sharing the same goal. If you have a different way of reaching it than they do, just explain yourself. Let them in on your plans, and there's a good chance they'll be much more comfortable giving you free rein. The emotional support you've been giving to so many people will start to come back to you. Utilize the shoulder that's being offered to you. It's okay to lean!</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 18, 2020:</span> You'll be strongly drawn to good things today, and you'll be willing to do just about whatever it takes to experience the highest quality you can. That might require traveling farther to go to that bakery with those killer brownies, waiting in a long line to get the tickets you want, or paying a ridiculous amount for that special perfume. Quality is always important, but today you will have to go to extra lengths to ensure that you get it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 18, 2020:</span> Someone in your life is claiming to be working hard at improving things between the two of you, but have you seen any real evidence of it? Your patience (not surprisingly) might be running awfully thin right now, so feel free to tell them that you need to see a little bit more progress in order to feel as though you've been adequately heard. Things will get better once you improve your communication, so don't beat around the bush. Be honest and open about how you feel.</p>
