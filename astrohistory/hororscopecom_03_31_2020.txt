Find something to do that engrosses you, even if it's only reading or catching up on paperwork. There's no point in just twiddling your thumbs!</p>

<p><strong>Mar 31, 2020</strong> - Business success may have come your way, Gemini, but today you could find yourself feeling a little sad and wondering why, since there's no real reason to feel this way. What's going on is probably, first of all, a letdown, since your brain is no longer churning out the endorphins. Second, you may be wondering where you go from here. Only you can decide that. Set a new goal and move on.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 31, 2020</strong> - Today you could feel torn between the desire to get a little exercise and a powerful inclination to curl up in your favorite chair and catch up on some reading, Cancer.

The key isn't giving up on one, but attaining a balance between the two.</p>

Are you haunted by the memory of a seemingly insignificant past event, but can't figure out why? It isn't a good idea to obsess over either. You'll remember whatever it is eventually. You'll soon realize the significance of the memory. Your subconscious is trying to tell you something. You can't rush it, so relax!</p>

<p><strong>Mar 31, 2020</strong> - If you've been thinking about starting a new creative project, Virgo, don't try to do it today. Friends and family could vie for your attention and distract you.

<p><strong>Mar 31, 2020</strong> - Is your sweetheart out of town, Capricorn? If so, you're probably feeling a bit lonely and insecure. You need to ignore those fantasies of your beloved out on the town having a great time with lots of glamorous people.

Both you and your romantic interest may be overloaded with responsibilities now and unable to see each other much. It's frustrating, but you'll get through it. In the meantime, don't let your insecurities get the better of you. Just because your friend is busy doesn't mean that your relationship is on the rocks. Be patient!</p>
