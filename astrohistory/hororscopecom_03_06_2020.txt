<p><strong>Mar 6, 2020</strong> - The key for you is to minimize your daily drama as much as possible, Leo.

<p><strong>Mar 6, 2020</strong> - Be careful of advertising yourself as someone who is so strong and mentally competent that you're capable of handling everything, Virgo. Take note that the strongest mule on the trail usually ends up carrying the most weight. Your emotions are more sensitive than you may think, and certainly more than you demonstrate to others. Be honest about the way you feel and not just the way you think.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 6, 2020</strong> - Your sensual nature is heightened, Sagittarius, and you'll find yourself engaged in tender moments and languid peacefulness in the company of others.

<p><strong>Mar 6, 2020</strong> - Allow your eager and restless nature to express itself in ways other than through the spoken word, Capricorn. Show someone that you care through your gentle touch or a big bear hug. Hold on a little bit more tightly than you might normally. There's an unspoken understanding that comes when you communicate through nothing but pure silence. Work on developing this kind of connection with those closest to you.</p>

Don't make it worse for yourself by pretending that you don't notice others' hurt feelings. People are likely to be extra sensitive today, so be careful about trying to impose your will on someone who really wants nothing more than an ear to talk to and a shoulder to cry on.</p>
