<p><span class="date">Mar 4, 2020:</span> Any problems that pop up will be easy to identify and easy to solve. You're in charge here, so don't let anyone rush you. Your insight is the most valuable possession you'll ever have, so cherish it and exercise it like you would exercise any other muscle. Listen to your gut when it comes to any business or financial dealings today. Any contracts put in front of you today will have some mighty small type, and you'd better read every single word.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 4, 2020:</span> If your temper (or the temper of the people around you) is rising today, just ride it out. There's a lot of tumultuous energy in the air today, likely caused by some transitions or adaptations you made a long time ago that are still having repercussions in all areas of your life. Don't ignore the problems that are going on, but don't let them control your day. These aren't fires you need to extinguish. They're merely facts you need to deal with.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 4, 2020:</span> There are multiple mazes and puzzles around you that you need to solve today, and they've been mostly created by people who don't realize what they're doing. Focus your frustration on solving the problem and getting to your desired destination. Don't waste any of your energy on blame or culpability. Even if those people who are making things complicated fess up to the charges, nothing will change. The problem will remain. Stay solution oriented.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 4, 2020:</span> People from different backgrounds or cultures could play an important role in your life today. Their charm and friendliness can provide you with the positive reinforcement you need, and they'll make you feel much more comfortable in an awkward situation. To foster this spirit of open-mindedness, be prepared to create a place where new people can meet and mingle. A social event like a dinner party or even bowling can help cultures meld instead of collide.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 4, 2020:</span> Lately, your eagerness to please other people is at odds with how much time you have available. It looks like you're due for some major re-prioritizing. It could be a little difficult to figure out who to assist first, but it's not the squeaky wheel that should get the grease first! You need to help the person who helps you whenever you need a leg up. It's time for a karmic payback, and you're the person who will be making the payment. You'll get a huge ego boost after lending them a hand.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 4, 2020:</span> No matter what your philosophy of life, you'll need to be open to different ways of thinking today. Someone in a power position can help you grow in your career or at school, but they don't feel the same way you do about a lot of important topics. It's time to agree to disagree with people who differ from you. You can't change people's minds about things that are important to them, so don't even try. Acceptance would be a good skill to learn today.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 4, 2020:</span> Business and romantic connections could intersect today in a potentially thrilling way. Could you be smack-dab in front of a major opportunity? Play this one carefully, and make sure you stay on the right side of that line between work and play. Building this relationship could pay off in a very big way, sending your life in a brand-new direction. Show them you have what it takes, but try not to come on too strong. Lead with your personality and just be yourself.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 4, 2020:</span> If you're seeking inspiration right now, look to the things in your life that are a source of frustration. It might sound counterintuitive, but the stars say that is the right idea. The things that are rubbing you the wrong way are doing so for a very good reason. Discover what that reason is and you'll find a solution to a growing problem. Fresh ideas grow out of stale situations, so as soon as you mix things up a bit, a whole new world can open up for you.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 4, 2020:</span> Entering some sort of competition today? If you're worried about being outsmarted, you shouldn't be! You're in an extremely vibrant phase right now. You're sharper than a tack, quicker than a whip, and much more charming than a puppy! Plus, you have an unbeatable secret weapon: your organizational skills. Do your research. Dig into the background of whatever you're facing. Once you get a complete picture, you'll know how to approach the situation.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 4, 2020:</span> A big test of your patience could come in the form of a rather demanding person today. But don't worry. The universe has loaded you up with an extra supply of tolerance, so you'll be prepared for whatever comes your way. None of your feathers can get ruffled right now, so it might be the perfect time to have that conversation you've been putting off with a relative. Your criticism defenses are nearly impenetrable, so a long lecture is something you'll be able to tolerate easily.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 4, 2020:</span> The last time you spent any time with old relatives, you learned a lot. Why not plan another visit with someone from your family who can offer some insight into your current conundrum? They know you much better than you think they do, and they can help you sort things out in order to see the right choices clearly. There's no better place to get loving honesty than from a family member, even someone you don't see very often. Blood ties are strong, and they can help you stay on the right path in life.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 4, 2020:</span> Get out of the past today. The days of yesteryear are relevant in terms of retro clothing styles, classic movies, architecture, and musical inspirations. It's the future you should be focusing on right now. When it comes to romance and personal growth, you have to let outmoded things pass. They are history for a reason. The days of chivalry might be dead, but in their wake comes a wiser, more equal time full of opportunity. Get with the current times and think modern.</p>
