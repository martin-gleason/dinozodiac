<p><span class="date">Apr 2, 2020:</span> The actions of other people could be very unpredictable today, so you need to be prepared for anything. And while this day may test your flexibility and patience, it will still be quite enjoyable. You like it when things are interesting, and unpredictability is part of the price you pay for "interesting." One of your friends might have an intriguing opportunity for you, but you need to have them explain things in more detail before you say yes.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 2, 2020:</span> You could be on a somewhat solid financial footing right now, although it wouldn't hurt to have a few more coins in your coffers. Put a little more effort into conserving more of your funds. The easiest way to do that is to cut out any luxury treats. Drink tea instead some fancy coffee. And don't leave your credit cards near your computer. You'll be less likely to succumb to that must-have item you see online.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 2, 2020:</span> You could feel a magnetic pull toward a person you've never met before. Resist the urge to cyber-stalk this person, but do keep an eye on them. There is a reason that they interest you, and if you can't figure out what it is, you need to get more information in order to do so. You've been waiting for someone to show you a better way of being with people. Could this be that someone? It might take time to determine this, but you should look for the answer.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 2, 2020:</span> There's no sense in hurrying to get things done today. It will only result in you wasting your energy. Sometimes it's easy to confuse being busy with getting things accomplished, but you need to keep your focus on what needs to happen today, not on what you would like to have happen tomorrow. Let that take care of itself. Try to work on the social aspect of your life a little bit more intensely. There are goals that you haven't met yet.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 2, 2020:</span> Fire up your laptop and start a spreadsheet, because you need to stay on top of all the details that will be flying at you today!

Your life needs to be all about black-and-white facts right now. This will enable you to get more focused and reduce the drama in your life.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 2, 2020:</span> Even if you don't have a sweetheart right now, this day could be full of romance for you! If you're not going to be falling in love with another person all over again, you'll be falling in love with yourself all over again, which might feel ten times as sweet. You're a wonderful person, and even if there's no one in your life right now to remind you of that fact, you can remind yourself. It's a nice, powerful feeling to tell yourself how special you are.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 2, 2020:</span> Are you getting bored? The best cure for that is to take a few risks! Try to put yourself in a situation where you could be rejected, or at least come out with less than you put in. You shouldn't do anything too silly, like spend your life savings on lottery tickets, but you should do something a little daring. Maybe it's time to call that certain someone, try out a trendy new fashion look, or try your hand at fixing a complicated gourmet dinner.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 2, 2020:</span> Try to use a form of communication that is a little out of the ordinary today. Telephone calls, letters, even e-mails are just so old school! You'll get your message across—whatever it is—a lot more effectively if you use some creativity, especially if you're trying to get your feelings across to a potential new sweetheart. Use beautiful words in a poetic sense to let them see into your heart. Whether you literally write a poem or not is up to you. Just make sure they know how you feel.</p>
