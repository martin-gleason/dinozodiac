<p><span class="date">Feb 27, 2020:</span> New things could catch your attention today, alerting you to new people, new ideas, and exciting new opportunities that you never knew existed before. Tradition has its place, but that place is nowhere in your life right now. A special relationship is growing a little bit more tense, but these are normal growing pains you're experiencing, not signs that trouble is brewing between you two. Time apart is what the both of you might need.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 27, 2020:</span> There are times that you should be conservative and take things nice and slow, and then there are times you should throw all caution to the wind and just go for it! Guess what time it is today? There will be opportunities tossed your way, and you need to accept as many as possible. Time won't be a factor. You'll be able to squeeze in much more than you realize. From saying yes to a dinner invitation to accepting a bigger project at work, it's time to go for it!</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 27, 2020:</span> Negotiating relationships will be easy today because no one can argue with the points you're making. Your ability to combine complex viewpoints with clear-headed simplicity is an unbeatable combination, and it will help everyone keep the proper perspective. Step up and play peacemaker between the warring co-workers or friends around you. You may be the only person who can let cooler heads prevail. Suggest they see things from the opposite person's point of view.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 27, 2020:</span> The universe is flexible enough to accommodate whatever you need, but you'll have ask for it. If you vocalize your plans and accept the challenges ahead of you, everything will be easier and the pace of your day will be exactly what you need—slow if you're dealing with complicated matters or fast if you're on autopilot. It's important to prepare yourself early in the day for what is going to happen later, and the earlier the better.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 27, 2020:</span> If you're in a quandary right now, turn to someone who has years of experience in the subject that's confusing you. Their insightful intelligence is greater than their communication skills, so be patient and be prepared to ask a lot of questions to clarify what they're talking about. If nothing is perplexing you right now, it's time to find someone you can help. Check in with a troubled friend and find out what you can do to cheer them up.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 27, 2020:</span> Not everyone can be as open-minded as you usually are, and that fact might frustrate you today. There could be a person near you who makes a comment that you find disappointing, to say the least. But the situation might not be one in which you feel free to speak your mind. This is a time to let things be, not step up and set this person straight. Don't feel guilty about not opening their mind and raising their consciousness. That's not your job.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 27, 2020:</span> Today you'll be fixing all sorts of problems with your own special brand of creativity. From dealing with something as minor as a broken zipper to handling something as major as work fallout from a missed deadline, you will master every little (unpleasant) surprise that comes your way. This is not to say that you should go out and seek controversy, however. Be sure to keep your eyes on you own paper—and mind your manners.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 27, 2020:</span> Someone could be starting a new phase in their life today, and you'll be especially tuned in to it. The purpose of your allegiance with this person isn't completely clear, but you'll serve as a witness, as proof of another person's fresh beginning. This person could be anyone—a family member, friend, or even a stranger. Your task is to stay present in the moment and be ready to gain inspiration from someone else's remarkable transformation.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 27, 2020:</span> More than ever before, you may notice the fabric of the community around you and your place in it. Everyone around you has an effect on your day, and this could be either a good thing or a bad thing. One car cutting you off might make you a few minutes late for work, but one person holding the elevator door could put you face-to-face with the person of your dreams for seven floors. Enjoy the unpredictable nature of how strangers and friends can influence the path of your day.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 27, 2020:</span> Get ready to have part of your daily routine disrupted, but don't get frustrated. Quite the contrary! You need to embrace the little fires that erupt throughout your day because they offer you some great opportunities to show what you're really made of. It's been a long time since you've been tested to this extent, and you could really use the exercise. It's nice to have a long period of calm, but you need to push yourself every once in a while.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 27, 2020:</span> Little changes in your life can create bigger and more inspiring changes down the road, so don't be afraid of them. Once the ball gets rolling, you can ride it to some amazing adventures. Getting too stuck in your routine isn't wise, especially now, when there are so many wonderful opportunities right around the corner. Trying new things, meeting new people, and going to new places are all great ways to kick-start your life. Head down a rewarding new path!</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 27, 2020:</span> Your imagination, dreams, and fantasies are offering you some amazing insights into the questions you've been asking yourself, and they could confirm a few suspicions. These visions give you a glimpse of the truth, an accurate account of reality as seen from outside your biased lens. You've been in a fog about someone for a while, and it's time to be up front and crystal clear about what you need and what you want. Go right to the source, and don't leave things open to interpretation.</p>
