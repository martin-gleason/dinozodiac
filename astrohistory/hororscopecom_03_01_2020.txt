<p><strong>Mar 1, 2020</strong> - You tend to be your own worst critic, Aries, and today you're more likely to be that way. Recent setbacks on the job might find you harboring doubts about your own capabilities. Be objective about the situation. Whatever happened was probably above and beyond your control, so it isn't fair to doubt yourself because of it. Work hard, continue to do the best you can, and don't let outside events sap your belief in yourself.</p>
