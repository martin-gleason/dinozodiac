<p><span class="date">Mar 10, 2020:</span> You've been sailing along nicely and capably navigating the most threatening waters for a good long while. You should be proud of how you've handled yourself recently. This pride will continue to carry you onward, but you should be on the lookout for a few obstacles. If your ship encounters especially choppy waters, you could spring an emotional leak. You'll have to plug the hole for now. You can deal with a more substantial repair once you're in a safe harbor.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 10, 2020:</span> Right now, you need to give yourself a lot of compassion, because soon you could be in the middle of things, and it could get pretty hot in that kitchen. The only way to keep cool is to stay confident. Don't pay attention to any negative energy that could start swirling around soon. Put your blinders on, turn off the outside world, and find comfort inside your mind. You'll find all the support, encouragement, and contentedness you need if you believe you deserve it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 10, 2020:</span> Money issues may be weighing heavily on your mind right now, although there's no reason to be nervous about it. You're merely more aware of the reality of your financial situation, which is a good thing. The more accurate your picture of where you stand now, the better prepared you are to get to where you need to be. If you're feeling thriftier or more conservative than you usually do, this isn't a panic-based reaction to a shortage of funds. But listen to your gut.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 10, 2020:</span> Getting involved in new projects or relationships isn't the best use of your time, so decline any invitations today, even if the opportunity seems promising. You just won't be able to devote the energy you need to ensure an initiative's success, and you won't make yourself proud. Stick to what is already on your plate. Peer pressure will get under your skin more than usual today. The best way to deal with it might be to isolate yourself from the herd.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 10, 2020:</span> There is plenty of room for compromise between what you want and what someone else wants right now, so don't be too dogmatic. Sure, applying cold logic to the situation could create a straightforward solution, but cold logic is just that—cold. And what you really need to make use of right now is warmth. Let your generosity and compassion play the leading role in any type of bargaining today. In the end, what you give up will be surpassed by the goodwill you gain.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 10, 2020:</span> Are you nervous about an upcoming family gathering? You shouldn't be. The stars say that there will be much more acceptance coming your way than you anticipated and way less judgment than you feared. Stop thinking about it so much, and just focus on the good aspects of getting back in touch with the people you know and love so well. Whether it's a big event or a small get-together, the outcome will be the same: You will be reminded how loved you are.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 10, 2020:</span> There is a strong interconnectedness among all the different elements of your life right now. Disparate people, places, and things will suddenly take on a harmonious vibe, syncing up and creating the foundation for something unique and quite beautiful. Now is the time to take your craziest germ of an idea and show it to the world. You are well positioned to gather up many different types of admirers who think that your way of doing things is pretty special.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 10, 2020:</span> There is a lack of follow-through in your professional life right now. It's obvious that no one is picking up the ball and running with it. Are you ready to get in the game and prove that you can be the MVP? If so, today is the perfect time to take control and point things where you want them to go. Your instincts are right on target, and if you can muster up enough bravado to get you through the day, you'll soon be riding on a wave of genuine confidence.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 10, 2020:</span> What are your plans for today? If you don't have an answer, you need to get to work! Find out what's up with your friends, and then find out how you can get involved. Or cook up some of your own plans with the people you know who are always up for something nutty. Don't limit yourself or your ideas. Think big and try to include options for your people to choose from. This is definitely a group effort, but ultimately you're in charge.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 10, 2020:</span> Some of your newer acquaintances are going to be in your life for quite a long while, so make sure you start things off on the right foot. Even if you have plans for a major change soon, don't expect much of a change in the cast of characters around you. Getting to know someone is an art form you've mastered. Today, put in some time to make this tenuous new connection more solid. It's as easy as asking questions and listening to the answers.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 10, 2020:</span> Getting enough exercise should be a top priority for you. Doing so will help keep you feeling positive, thinking positive, and looking positively gorgeous! You should realize that just like you can change your life through certain acts and deeds, you can also change your body through how much or how little you exercise. Diet is important to address now, too, but the stars say it's more important for you to get active and get your blood pumping.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 10, 2020:</span> Inspiration will be humming all around you and coming from predictable sources as well as a few very surprising ones. Sure, the gorgeous sky and the melodious sounds of nature ignite the poet in you, but don't be surprised if your creativity gets stimulated by the rhythm of traffic or the symmetry of grocery store checkout lines. Your brain is hungry for excitement, so much so that it will resort to some fun, creative ways to find it. Enjoy your new perspective.</p>
