<p><span class="date">Apr 11, 2020:</span> You need to take things more slowly in your relationships. Any impatience you show could only create more stress today, so try to let things unfold at their own pace. Don't try to rush ahead of people who are lagging behind. You need to slow down and stay with them. There could be too many details for them to take care of right away, so you should just wait while they catch up. Keep yourself busy until they call you to ask what the next step should be.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 11, 2020:</span> Sharing all your intimate details with close friends is a good way to get closer, but it's also a good way to get your secrets known to the world. Without realizing it, someone may come awfully close to spilling one of your biggest secrets today. Find the potential leak (you know who it is), and remind them to keep your confidence. An innocent comment could escalate into a touchy conversation with a family member. Take time apart to regroup and calm down.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 11, 2020:</span> Compromising might not seem like much fun right now, but you might have to let go of a few things that you thought were must-haves in order to keep the peace (or gain greater harmony) between you and your peers. Letting go of something you really want can be an empowering experience, but you aren't letting your desires overpower your common sense. Letting your goals mesh with the goals of other people will enrich your journey toward attaining them.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 11, 2020:</span> If you have an urge to go off on your own today, try to fight it. Your presence is strongly desired by people looking for a solution. Problem-solving might not always be your strength, but you can help the group find an answer just by putting in your two cents. Go ahead and connect with some people you normally wouldn't spend time with. Together, you can create something wonderful.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 11, 2020:</span> From this morning through tonight, you could be struck by an insatiable need for more, more, more of whatever you have right now. Your extravagant impulses are clearly in control right now, and while they might get you in some financially uncomfortable situations, they constitute an expression of how you feel about your life. Satisfaction isn't enough, though. You crave the energy that comes from indulging in the things that make you happy, and you won't feel a tinge of guilt.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 11, 2020:</span> From time to time, the awful truth arises: Not everyone has your best interests at heart. Believe the rumors or whispers you're hearing, but don't alter who you are or what you're about. Jealousy is driving this malevolence. Relationship issues could come to the fore today if it feels like someone may be holding you back. As long as you're happy with who you are and where you're going, you're okay. But if you wish things were different, you must talk to them about it today.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 11, 2020:</span> There is nothing like a strong sense of accomplishment to build your confidence. Today, make it your main task to finish as many things as you can. Even if you haven't been feeling down in the dumps about your situation, a little boost to your ego couldn't hurt, right? Plus, it will polish your reputation and get you noticed. Finish that report, finish that craft project you've been working on, just get stuff done.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 11, 2020:</span> Know when to step back today. When the drama around you gets too intense, step away and find a place to be by yourself. Negative energy may threaten to cast a shadow over your sunny mood today, so do what it takes to avoid it. If you're asked to choose sides, don't. And if you're asked your opinion, try to be as diplomatic as you can. There are fragile egos at stake, and you're feeling generous.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 11, 2020:</span> Talking to a family member may stir up some touchy emotions right now, but it's always better to get things out in the open than to keep them deep inside, isn't it? Do a quick inventory of what you've worked on lately in your personal life. What do you want to rid yourself of? Today, it might be time for a clean sweep. If you keep yourself busy with cleaning, budgeting, or other tasks, you'll get a lot done and feel a lot better.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 11, 2020:</span> You can get a lot done with just your enthusiasm today, so don't fret if you don't have every little detail ironed out right now. Bluffing isn't just something you can do in card games. Talk your way through any tricky spots today, and use your bright smile to blind any skeptics temporarily. Flattery is another secret weapon to buy the time you need. If you can keep someone talking about themselves, it won't occur to them to ask anything about you.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 11, 2020:</span> Try to spend some time surrounded by nature today. Take a long walk outside, work in the garden, or just admire the flowers in a neighbor's yard. Getting in touch with the earthy elements of life will keep you more grounded and balanced. The simple beauty of nature has a way of putting everything in healthy perspective. It shows you that things don't have to be complicated to be fulfilling.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 11, 2020:</span> There won't be a single, overriding goal that you have to accomplish today. Instead, you could be dealing with many different, smaller projects, none of which has an urgent deadline. So don't focus on completion or meeting a particular target. Instead, make like a circus clown and juggle as many tasks as you can with a sense of humor. This is also a good opportunity to get back to basics with your friends.</p>
