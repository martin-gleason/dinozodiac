<p><span class="date">Feb 16, 2020:</span> There's real heat growing between you and someone else. Unfortunately, this person probably isn't emotionally available right now (no matter how available they may look). You need to pull your heart out of this situation and look at it with practical eyes. Is all of this stress really worth the potential payoff? Probably not. Moving on might be difficult, but it may be the only way to deal with a situation in which you're not getting what you deserve.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 16, 2020:</span> Your social status is on a rapid upswing, and you'll be in high demand by a wide array of people. Invitations will be coming your way left and right, and you should let yourself be as choosy as you want to be about the ones you say yes to. Resist making any formal alliances with people until you know who they are and what they're all about. Your sentimentality is at an all-time high right now, so you could be seeing a connection where none truly exists.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 16, 2020:</span> If someone you know has recently been making a lot of promises but delivering on none of them, today is the day to say something. Ask this person why so many obligations have been neglected lately. The difficulty of your discussion is in direct proportion to how close the relationship is, so remember this for the future. It's not quite time for an ultimatum, but it is time to stop letting yourself be taken advantage of by people you like.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 16, 2020:</span> You're positively bursting with pride today, but it's not the bad kind that alienates people and makes you show off. It's the good kind, the kind that fills you with confidence and encourages you to lead people and inspire them. This is a great day to start a new group activity, especially if you're in charge. Social situations will be imbued with a very strong energy. It will almost feel as though a powerful current is carrying you and your people along.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 16, 2020:</span> Have the celebrities in your social circle been getting a bit too big for their britches lately? Popular people are not always popular for the right reasons, and the chinks in their armor are beginning to show today. If you are good friends with them, you'll be doing them a favor by telling them that it's time to fess up to the fact that they're only human. But if they aren't your friends, it's time to watch and learn how poor behavior gets rewarded.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 16, 2020:</span> Could there be too much happening in your life right now? Not according to the stars. They say that your capacity for thinking fast, working faster, and enjoying every minute of the craziness is incredibly high. If you have a lot on your plate, pile some more on! You have the time and you have the desire. Stepping up and taking on more responsibilities today will lead you to a better future, financially and romantically. People like busy people.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 16, 2020:</span> Pinning all of your hopes on one person isn't a wise idea right now, so try to be realistic about your expectations. This person might be pretty awesome, but they may not be capable of delivering what you want right now. It wouldn't be wise to express your fears or concerns to this person. Any undue pressure will make this already imperfect idea even more problematic. Things are working just fine as they are, so why try to change them now?</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 16, 2020:</span> If you've been separated from the world while nursing a bruised ego, it's time for you to get back into the game! Whether you feel ready or not, today is the day to step up and shift back into life. You have a lot of beauty and strength to showcase, and there are plenty of people who want to have a front-row seat for the show. There is more interest in you right now than you think. You are missing an amazing opportunity by standing on the sidelines.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 16, 2020:</span> Having good luck isn't always a passive experience. You can't just wait for a kind genie to arrive at your doorstep and grant you three wishes. In order to enjoy more luck in your life right now, you have to create it, starting today. Put more positive energy out there, and do your own best impersonation of a kind fairy godparent to someone in your life. An anonymous gift or good deed will go a long way toward putting more happy coincidences in your life.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 16, 2020:</span> Your desire to make a connection with new people deserves to be satisfied, so reach out and approach that person who has been making you smile lately. It won't be difficult to make new friends if that's truly what you want. Your values are shared by more people than you might realize, so go out and explore the world around you. Get out of your car and walk around. Let your physical energy mix up with the energy of other people.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 16, 2020:</span> Paradoxically, accepting a compromise could put you in a much more powerful position than pushing aggressively to get your own way. Showing that you have the maturity and tact to negotiate with someone who rubs you the wrong way will send a very powerful signal to some important people you want to impress. Let go of the "my way or the highway" mentality. Think about long-term gains, not short-term rewards.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 16, 2020:</span> Eavesdropping on interesting conversations can be a fun pastime, but it can also get you into a lot of trouble if you aren't careful. Play it safe and mind your own business whenever possible today. You don't necessarily have to totally give up the pleasure of listening to other people talking, but resist the temptation to butt in or get involved in some way. How other people choose to live their lives might shock you, but you needn't tell them that.</p>
