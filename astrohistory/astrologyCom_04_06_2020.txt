<p><span class="date">Apr 6, 2020:</span> Don't be surprised if you start feeling more emotionally connected to the people around you, especially your family members.

You are entering a very happy phase, and today will remind you how lucky you are.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 6, 2020:</span> A culture clash could be a very positive experience for you today. You're likely to find out about someone from another country who has a lot to offer you, either in terms of your career or your romantic life. If possible, plan to spend some time socializing over food at your earliest opportunity. That will be a great way to get to know each other better. It will become clear that you have a lot to offer this person, too.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 6, 2020:</span> Even if you feel pressured to spend money today, avoid doing so. So what if friends are buying new gadgets or planning luxury vacations? Tell them to have fun without you. You need to keep yourself as far away from spending temptations as possible. Being tight with money isn't a bad thing right now, and you're quite clever about figuring out ways to pinch pennies here and there. Use your creativity to save your cash!</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 6, 2020:</span> You might have to do twice the work to get half the results today, but you won't mind expending the extra effort. Work will bring you joy today, especially if there is physical labor involved. Your mind will be set free if your hands are busy building, shaping, or cleaning. This is an excellent day to tackle some major household chores. Find some good music to listen to and roll up your sleeves. You'll be very happy with your progress by the end of the day.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 6, 2020:</span> Scientists always perform their experiments in controlled environments, and you should do the same today. Whatever your theories, they deserve to be explored in a realistic and honest way. Test a recent hypothesis without letting anyone else in on your plan. Your expectations could influence their actions and skew your results. Right now, you need everyone to be as real as they can be. This isn't a good time to encourage anyone to stir up trouble.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 6, 2020:</span> If someone asks you to help organize something, you might not like the sound of the proposal, but you should still jump at the opportunity to get involved. Five minutes into the task, you could be very glad you did. Right now, your ability to organize, categorize, and prioritize is incredibly sharp, and you'll be a valuable team member. Plus, you'll also get a lot of joy out of creating order in the world.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 6, 2020:</span> If your current projects aren't making you feel fulfilled or challenged right now, just stick with them! The act of persevering will be a big enough challenge to keep your mind occupied. This is a chance to develop your patience. Plus, sooner or later things will start to gain some traction and you'll start to feel a growing sense of future possibilities. Getting through this rough patch will educate you and enable you to handle drama easily in the future.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 6, 2020:</span> When you enter a very familiar situation today, try not to control it. You might know exactly what to do, but everyone needs to feel like a part of the decision-making process. You should step back and let someone else take charge. But it's also important not to bend over backward to get along with everyone. There is no sense in wasting energy on trying to charm people who are more interested in getting work done than in making an emotional connection.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 6, 2020:</span> Just because you and your close friend or partner have a conflict every once in a while, that doesn't mean that the two of you are mismatched. The fact is, people disagree from time to time, but that doesn't mean they don't care about each other. You would do well to learn how to get comfortable with conflict right now. That doesn't mean you should pick a fight, but it does mean that you should realize that conflict can be a legitimate—and healthy—way to communicate.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 6, 2020:</span> It's sometimes difficult for you to accept change, especially when it involves saying goodbye to something (or someone) who has brought joy to your life. But things change, and people move in new directions, and you need to accept that. Besides, the transitions that are happening in your life right now could have positive long-term results. While they won't all be easy to go through, they'll do wonders for your self-confidence.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 6, 2020:</span> If something is broken, you need to fix it right away and then get on with your life. The path you're on right now has a few distractions and pitfalls, so you don't have time to waste on trying to figure out the best way to improve a situation that's less than perfect. Fast action is required. So have whatever tools you may need at the ready. You need to concentrate on forward motion in your life. There's no time for backward glances.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 6, 2020:</span> Your creativity is a blessing today. It will allow you to have fun and get out of an unpleasant assignment that you may have been dreading. Don't waste a single second before you go away from the responsibilities and toward the blissful good times that await. You can't let yourself feel bad for the people left behind, even if they have to pick up the slack. It's not your fault that they lack the skills you posses. And they don't hold it against you.</p>
