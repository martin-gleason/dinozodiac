Before jumping to any conclusions, phone someone who knows what's going on and find out the truth. What you've heard is probably just gossip.</p>

<p><strong>Apr 6, 2020</strong> - You tend to be very intuitive, Libra, but today you could find your psychic abilities short-circuit. If you give readings, don't schedule any for today. This isn't to say your abilities are blocked, but they aren't as dependable as they usually are. Likewise, your imagination isn't as reliable either. Don't worry. This is just typical writer's or artist's block. You'll be back to normal by tomorrow.</p>
