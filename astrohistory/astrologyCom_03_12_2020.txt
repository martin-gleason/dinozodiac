<p><span class="date">Mar 12, 2020:</span> Attending a family gathering could give you a fresh perspective on where you want to take your life. It seems that stories from the past are great places to find inspiration for your future. Try not to hide your newest developments from family members. They want the opportunity to share in your joy and offer some unsolicited advice. Instead of resisting their input, take it all in and be grateful they care so much about you. You're lucky.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 12, 2020:</span> In any and all confrontations you have today, be sure to take the high road. Let aggressive drivers zoom right by you, and simply smile if someone tries to blame you for something they did. Your maturity is more than enough of an antidote to whatever poison is in the air today. Refusing to fly off the handle emotionally will enable you to understand what you're feeling all the better. Try to keep a more impersonal point of view about things right now.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 12, 2020:</span> Some of the spendthrifts in your life are going to be a lot more thrifty and conservative than usual, and you should follow their example. Even if your current financial situation is fairly stable, it wouldn't do you any harm to tighten your purse strings a little bit. Bringing your lunch from home is an easy first step. You can even make it fun by concocting a new dish to try each day. You'll save money and expand your culinary experience!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 12, 2020:</span> Try to add more exercise to your daily routine. Your physical self is something you can control a lot more than your emotional self right now, so you might as well make the best of it. Your body is under your control, so what do you want it to do? Take note of what you're putting into it, what you're putting it through, and what you're expecting from it. If all three of those things don't add up, it's time for you to make a change.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 12, 2020:</span> This morning, dress in clothes that can let you go from an uptight business meeting to a wild party, because this will be an expansive day full of opportunity. You never know where a conversation will take you, especially today, so you have to be prepared for anything. Friendships could be created on a whim, and they can also end (with no hard feelings) that way. Insert yourself in the middle of a group. Even if you have nothing to say, you'll naturally be warmly welcomed.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 12, 2020:</span> From the very start of your day, you could be picking up on all the energy of people around you. Sadness, happiness, anger, terror, all of these diverse emotions will be coming at you today. At first, it will be invigorating to be able to sense what's going on around you so astutely, but soon the barrage could get tiring. Step out of the public arena by the afternoon and go off somewhere by yourself. It will help you regain balance between yourself and the outside world.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 12, 2020:</span> By living a generous life, you become an inspiration to the people around you. Someone in your social circle who's known for being inflexible is suddenly realizing that they aren't the only person on earth. Your good example is part of the reason they're changing! Your influence is widening and may begin to affect people in your professional or scholastic life as well. Your leadership qualities shouldn't be camouflaged. You need to own them and use them.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 12, 2020:</span> Your mood may swing back and forth like a pendulum today, and your emotional reactions might not always be in line with what's going on around you. Don't be surprised if you find yourself laughing hysterically at a boring comment or sobbing during an infomercial. Your emotions will be very close to the surface and unpredictable. Try to ride your swinging feelings without pushing back too hard. This could be a good opportunity to get cozy with uncomfortable emotions.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 12, 2020:</span> A team-related success is still something you were a big part of. Don't let your humble nature prevent you from being proud of what you did. Take a bow as part of the team, and bask in the knowledge that it couldn't have happened without you. Own your success. Being in touch with your importance is relevant to your entire day. You have key roles in the lives of many people who love you. A mentor would like to hear from you, so drop them a line soon.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 12, 2020:</span> Someone close to you is going through some major mood swings right now, so beware that a giggle may turn to tears with little, if any, provocation. Don't take it personally if you seem to trigger a surprising reaction. There are a lot of things going on that you may not be aware of, and these extreme changes of behavior are the start of a trend that may rub off on you. Ride your emotions like a roller coasterâ€”with your hands held straight up!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 12, 2020:</span> Even though you love them dearly, your family isn't totally in sync with you right now. Don't be surprised if you have a hard time communicating with them. Stop thinking so hard about how to reach them and just start saying what you truly want. It may be difficult, but you should come clean with what you're feeling. Why not just speak from the heart? You might be surprised by how warmly you're received. Have you been selling your family short? Expect the best and you could get it!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 12, 2020:</span> As a calm comes over your emotional life, look for other areas of your life to grow more peaceful as well. For any social outings today, try to choose an intimate spot that's conducive to private conversations. Avoid crowded places with loud music or a raucous clientele. Even your wardrobe should reflect your calmness with neutral colors and comfortable fabrics that frame your face and let your personality provide all the color.</p>
