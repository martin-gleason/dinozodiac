<p><span class="date">Apr 8, 2020:</span> You might not be feeling all that great at the start of the day, but other people sure think you're looking great! This confirmation of your attractiveness will do wonders for your physical and mental health. Accept the adoration and compliments graciously—this isn't a day to pretend to be humble. Agree with people when they say you're cute (because, gosh darn it, you are!), and expect your mood to continue to skyrocket as the day continues.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 8, 2020:</span> All of the unresolved romantic issues in your life aren't as confusing to you as they once were, probably because you're getting a handle on what you want and don't want. Someone you know well could be going through a similar phase and would appreciate any insight you can provide. This is a great day for sharing dating tips, tricks, and ideas. Your creativity is going to help you come up with new ways of getting close to people.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 8, 2020:</span> It would be good for you to set a few goals today, but try to keep them as simple and attainable as possible. Right now, you need to remind yourself how capable and smart you are! Your famous ability to be reasonable and flexible will come in very handy, so think about making an adjustment that has seemed somewhat difficult in the past. You're in a phase where you're more willing than ever to see things from a new and fresh perspective.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 8, 2020:</span> If you're focusing on new beginnings right now, are you losing sight of maintaining old connections? Don't forget that every step you've made in the past has led you to where you are now and will help you get to where you need to go. Make time for old friends as well as new friends. Send a thank-you note to that teacher or mentor who inspired you. Realize that your life is not just about the future.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 8, 2020:</span> A new person who enters your life today might not have a naturally warm personality, so don't take it personally if your charm seems to have little or no effect. This person just needs time to get accustomed to a new situation and new people. Give them space for a few days and then make another effort to connect. This is definitely not the right time to make anyone feel under any type of pressure.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 8, 2020:</span> Today, even a slight change in your daily routine could put a major crimp in some future social plans. Your schedule might be flexible, but your friends' schedules may not be. Before rearranging any group plans, make sure you touch base with everyone and get their agreement, even if it doesn't seem necessary. You can't assume that they can move their dates around the way you can. If you do, you could spark some resentment.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 8, 2020:</span> There are two different emotions swimming around in your heart right now, and this duality might be confusing you to the point of frustration. It's time to slow down and remind yourself that you don't have to make any sort of commitment or decision right this moment. Move these emotions up into your head and turn them into logical thoughts that you can see in a more analytical way. Getting your emotions organized will help.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 8, 2020:</span> You're always happiest when the people you love are happy. Unfortunately, not everyone around you may be completely happy right now. You're usually very good at knowing when someone is putting on a happy face just to set your mind at ease, and that is especially true today. Keep an eye out for someone who seems to be putting on an act. Being in such a strong intuitive space will enable you to reach out with the right words to cheer them up.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 8, 2020:</span> If you think you're completely in charge of your day today, you're in for a big surprise! It won't be another person, an unpleasant occurrence, or even inclement weather that mucks up the works; it will be your unpredictable mood. The worst thing you can do is force yourself to do things you don't really want to do or pretend to be enthusiastic about something when you aren't really all there. Just go with the flow and feel whatever it is you feel.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 8, 2020:</span> Someone has a few new ideas to share with you today, but will you have the time to listen? Try to slow down your normal routine long enough to hear people who don't normally have enough power or influence to bend your ear. You are one of those rare people who don't judge books by their covers! Today, keep that open mind, especially when someone says something that rubs you the wrong way. There is something there that's worth investigating.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 8, 2020:</span> It might not be easy to open up and let someone new into your life, but things worth doing are often difficult. You sense that you should let down your guard a little, and you should trust yourself this time. The doubts and fears will always be there, but you don't have to listen to them today. Listen to your heart, and understand that you're capable of handling the consequences of your actions. Life is yours to sculpt. Be bold and creative!</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 8, 2020:</span> There are lots of opportunities coming your way right now, and you'll definitely want to get involved in many of them, even though they might require a bit of hard work. Entertaining might be a chore to some people, but right now you're looking forward to it. Get the boring errands off your plate as much as you can, so you'll be better prepared to take on as much as you can handle in the near future. Your energy is growing, and you're going to be on a roll!</p>
