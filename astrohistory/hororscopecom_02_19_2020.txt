<p><strong>Feb 19, 2020</strong> - A friend, perhaps a woman, could well be upset or even angry with you today, Aries. Money might be involved in some way. There may be nothing you can do to reassure her at this time, so it's best to give what reassurances you can and then back off. Whatever has gone wrong, she's probably overreacting, and eventually she'll see that. In the meantime, you do what you can to work off your own anxieties. Hang in there!</p>

<p><strong>Feb 19, 2020</strong> - Is your boss a woman, Taurus? If so, stay out of her way today. To put it mildly, she isn’t in a good mood. Work hard, be very sweet to everyone, and make copious use of your innate diplomacy. You may be on the receiving end of some sharp words, but by remaining focused and continuing your routine in your usual efficient manner, you should avoid any major blowups. Try to stay calm, and hope she goes home early!</p>

Try to short-circuit potential problems. Use a checklist when packing, keep valuables close to you, and take lots of books and CDs in case you have to wait out a delay. In spite of it all, have fun!</p>

<p><strong>Feb 19, 2020</strong> - Someone you work with might need a sympathetic shoulder to cry on today, Sagittarius.

<p><strong>Feb 19, 2020</strong> - Children or possibly some close friends or a love interest could be upset today, Capricorn. The financial coffers aren't full enough to afford something they think they absolutely have to have right now. You might find yourself having to soothe their feelings, reassuring them that "not now" doesn't necessarily mean "never." If they don't respond, don't keep pushing. They'll have to come to terms with the situation in their own way.</p>

<p><strong>Feb 19, 2020</strong> - Worry about a family member may be on your mind today, Aquarius. This person could be all wrought up over work, money, or possibly a love affair that's broken off. Say whatever reassuring words you can muster, but don't expect him or her to respond, and don't fall into the trap of feeling that your kind words were all in vain. They did register. It's just going to take this person a while to come to terms with the situation.</p>

<p><strong>Feb 19, 2020</strong> - Uneasy feelings may be plaguing you throughout the day, Pisces. There could appear to be no valid reason for this. Everything seems to be going well for you, and no one close to you has anything heavy going on. It's probably nothing Earthshaking. You may just be intuitively picking up on the troubles and anxieties of people you pass on the street. Your intuition is high today, so you could psychically sense just about anything. Hang in there!</p>
