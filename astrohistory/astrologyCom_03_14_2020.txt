<p><span class="date">Mar 14, 2020:</span> Your organizational skills are top-notch today, and there simply can't be too many details for you to wrangle! More than ever, you're getting a great deal of fulfillment from turning chaos into order. If there were a better way to organize the alphabet, you'd be the one to figure it out! From lining up all your pens to organizing your underwear drawer by color, you'll have a blast putting everything in your life in order today.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 14, 2020:</span> There is never a good time to tell someone bad news, but there are ways of easing the blow. If you need to deliver a harsh message to someone you love, make sure you're ready to offer them some emotional support should they need it. Give yourself plenty of time for this conversation, and definitely do not do it over the phone or via e-mail! You can turn a potentially unpleasant experience for them into a rewarding and bonding experience for the both of you.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 14, 2020:</span> There may be some problems between you and one of your family members right now, but it's nothing you can't all overcome in due time. There is something true in this generational gap theory, as you will see today in a dramatic way. Respect your elders, but don't fret about obeying them! If you're having a hard time communicating with your family, the stars say you should take a break from them. A little distance will help everyone gain some healthy perspective.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 14, 2020:</span> All the e-mails, text messages, and phone calls you receive today could deliver positive news. Not only that, but one of these messages could be from someone who is interested in seeing you again after a long time apart. You might have to read between the lines to understand the full extent to which they want to have you in their life again, but go with your gut, and be prepared for your reunion to be a negotiation.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 14, 2020:</span> A recent relationship rift caused by finances isn't something you should take lightly. Just because money might be a sore subject with you doesn't mean that it shouldn't be a topic of conversation—quite the contrary! You need to get over any hang-ups you may have about money matters in your love life. If you and your partner have different philosophies about making, saving, and spending money, then the sooner you come to an agreement the better!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 14, 2020:</span> You might have a tough time getting out the door in the morning, but you should perk up by afternoon. A surprising surge of energy, combined with a few unexpected hours of free time, will inspire you to do some tidying up. Picking up around the house, filing away the piles of paper on your desk, organizing your closet, cleaning out your car, or just getting the contents of your wallet all sorted out will give you a great sense of accomplishment and be a wonderful use of your time.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 14, 2020:</span> When it comes to an upcoming date, you can't be too meticulous about your appearance. Is it time for a shopping trip? If you've got the time (and a few extra dollars in your pocket), the stars say that you should check out the new fashions. You're likely to find the perfect item. Be mindful of the attitude you're giving off right now, and remember that your image does send a message to potential new friends and lovers.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 14, 2020:</span> Today, the question to ask about your friends is not "What have they done for me lately?" The question to ask is "What can I do to help them?" Reaching out to the people in your life with a selfless act or gesture is the best way to convey how important they are to you. They might be surprised at first, but they'll enjoy the attention. Sharing your time, your money, and some of your stellar advice will take you both to a whole new level.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 14, 2020:</span> Obeying authority can be difficult for anyone from time to time, but today you could discover that being on the other side of the power structure can be just as challenging! You might be placed into a leadership role that is flattering, but it may also be somewhat challenging. If you feel at any point that you're in over your head, turn to that trusted co-worker or friend you always count on for the whole truth and nothing but the truth. They'll keep you grounded.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 14, 2020:</span> This is a great day for you and your people to plan the details of an upcoming event or party. Have everyone sync their calendars. It will be delightfully easy to get everyone together at the same time in the same place. While you're on this roll, you might want to consider making this thing a regular event. You can't get enough of the people who make you feel good about who you are and where you're going.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 14, 2020:</span> Making major business deals might be a new sensation for you, but that's no reason to be intimidated by the suits in the room. Just take your time and read things through. In general, be very careful in any business deals. Financial matters that look too good to be true probably are, and you need to find the facts that show you why. Don't rush forward and put your signature on the dotted line just because you think you'll impress someone. You won't.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 14, 2020:</span> Things are well on their way toward gaining real momentum in one of your newest relationships. This is a mature partnership built on mutual respect and a shared sense of how to treat another person. Get ready for some new allegiances, all of which will be challenging but rewarding. This is a person you can truly rely on, and a person you should rely on. You are starting to align yourself with the people who deserve you. Let people from your past stay in your past.</p>
