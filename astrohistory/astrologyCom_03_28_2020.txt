<p><span class="date">Mar 28, 2020:</span> Even more than usual, your dreams and fantasies will provide entertainment and insight for other people today. When you share what you want, you can help people articulate what they want out of their lives. Lead by example! It's easy for you to spread encouragement and positive energy to the people who love you just by being yourself. What you hope for out of your own life inspires others. And helping others can give you a very strong sense of purpose.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 28, 2020:</span> Your recent time crunch is finally starting to loosen up, and your calendar actually has some empty spots in it! Fill them up with a bunch of fun stuff before boring responsibilities come tumbling down on you. It's time to ask all your friends what's next on the good-time agenda. Get creative in these unusual times. </p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 28, 2020:</span> Things aren't going to happen by themselves! Whether it's a new diet, virtual class, or something else, you have to make plans if you want things to reach their full potential. Spontaneity has its place in life, but you also have to be clear-headed about how you're going to accomplish your goals right now. You can't just wish and hope for something to be true. Too many things are up in the air right now. You've got to pull them all down to earth and sort through them.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 28, 2020:</span> Don't be surprised if, in the middle of a conversation, your mind starts to wander. At first, you might wonder why you can't follow this person's line of thinking. But then you'll realize that they're just boring! Few people are as charming as you, especially right now. You're in a phase where your personality is very strong, and you need an equal match to stay engaged. Seek out people who are larger than life. They will keep you fascinated and keep you talking.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 28, 2020:</span> Personal relationships, whether romantic in nature or not, need space to grow. If you're feeling someone slipping away from you, the last thing you should do is to try to hold on to them even tighter or claim ownership over them. You could be clinging too tightly right now when what you really need to do is let go. Two people might come together in a partnership, but they're still two people who need to stay in touch with their individual identities.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 28, 2020:</span> This is a good day to take another look at any brewing tension in one of your closest relationships. Don't be afraid to be brutally honest with yourself about what's been going on. The sooner you face your fears, the sooner you'll see that they aren't that scary after all. Some strange cross communication has been going on, and it might be time for you and this person to figure out what exactly you're doing in each other's lives. Good things can come from having a conversation.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 28, 2020:</span> One of your partnerships (maybe romantic, maybe not) could be going through a state of confusion right now. You're not quite sure where you stand. Unfortunately, neither one of you is thinking what the other person is thinking. In order to get the two of you on the same page as quickly as possible, have a conversation. Instead of assuming that nothing is wrong, make sure that nothing is wrong! It won't take long to get things back in harmony.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 28, 2020:</span> Take a break from all the heavy thinking you've been doing about work or school. Today, you should let other people deal with all of the headaches for a while. You've paid your dues and invested your fair share of energy in the problem. It's someone else's turn to sweat! This is a good day to just focus on doing some fun things, so don't waste a minute of your time worrying about how things will go without you at the helm. It'll all work out just fine!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 28, 2020:</span> Your good memory is going to come in quite handy today, especially if you experience a blast from the past. As soon as you hear from the person, let your mind go back in time to when you last saw them. In seconds, you're likely to know exactly what subject to bring up and when. They'll be tickled pink and totally flattered that you remembered them. You're about to embark on a lovely walk down memory lane, and it could lead to a much more lucrative future.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 28, 2020:</span> Today, feel free to put your brain on autopilot when it comes to your daily tasks. Save up all your cognitive abilities for the interactions you have with other people, especially the people who are newer to your life. It's important for you to really connect with people right now. They can shed light on a problem you've been dealing with, but only if you pay attention to what they say. Getting personal could be just what you need.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 28, 2020:</span> Budget and money confusion abounds right now. Are you sure that you have accounted for all of your cash? Make sure, because the chances are good that you could be misled by your bank statement right now. Double-check the figures. You should never take chances with your credit or your health. And on that note, getting healthier requires you to get more diligent about preventive care. Make sure you're doing all you can for your well-being.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 28, 2020:</span> The energy in your day could be mismatched—you'll be up when others are down; you'll be ready for quiet time when everyone else wants to play. But this inequality doesn't mean you'll have a bad day. It just means that you'll have additional considerations. Who knows? Maybe you can bring everyone up to your level or convince them that mellow is the better way to go. With your charm, it wouldn't be surprising!</p>
