<p><strong>Apr 4, 2020</strong> - Feeling grumpy lately, Taurus? Don't fret, because your bad mood won't last. This attitude is unlike you. Co-workers notice your change in personality but still treat you with consideration and respect. You're fortunate to be able to draw upon a considerable wealth of kindness and good karma that you have built up over the years. Your friends and loved ones treat your mood as an aberration, which is exactly what it is.</p>

<p><strong>Apr 4, 2020</strong> - Generally, you come up with the perfect, witty answer one day too late. Impulse and intuition take a back seat to your excellent self-control.

You might have to deal with a co-worker who steps on your toes or runs roughshod over your gentle nature. Defend yourself with your favorite weapons - silence, laughter, and perspective.
