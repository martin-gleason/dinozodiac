<p><span class="date">Mar 16, 2020:</span> If you're feeling the urge to start something that offers you a challenge, today could bring you a great opportunity to do just that. It's a very good time to initiate a new work, school, or hobby project, and if legal documents are involved, so much the better. You've been doing a lot of clear thinking, and the conclusions you've come to are right on the nose, so you have no reason to doubt your convictions. Things are about to get interesting, and you should be very pleased.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 16, 2020:</span> Too much couch and television time can make a person start to feel a bit lazy, no? You might need to get up and get active, even if you have no idea what you'll do. Just get up, get out of the house, and go for a walk. See where your feet take you! And the destination might not be as important as the journey. Pick a place that has a lot going on. The people-watching should be memorable, and who knows? You might run into someone you haven't seen in a while.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 16, 2020:</span> Ready for action? You'd better be, because the stars are sending you something unexpected and very exciting your way. It could be a hot, new romance, it could be an unexpected windfall, or it could be a perfectly prepared cup of coffee. Whether it's a simple pleasure or a knock-your-socks-off surprise, wonderful things are in store. Your only task is to open up your mind and welcome them all in! It's a day when all your karmic investments could finally pay off.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 16, 2020:</span> If you stay open to different ideas today, you could gain a valuable insight that most other people would kill for. It makes sense: In order to fill your mind, you have to open it! Having some insider information puts you in a very powerful position right now, so be prepared for people to wait for your direction. You might be put into a leadership role without really wanting to be the big boss, but you'll have to learn how to tell other people what to do eventually!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 16, 2020:</span> You could have a very fun day today, full of silliness and laughter galore. Take the time to enjoy yourself, and put aside any serious work for a while if you can. Opt for enjoying social time instead of engaging in study time, and you'll stay energized and smiling all day. It's not that your workload isn't enjoyable; it's just that you need to engage your fun side more than your studious side right now. It's way overdue for a workout!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 16, 2020:</span> Today, having a discussion with someone amusing could open up your mind to a whole new way of thinking, but it won't change your ideas about what is right and what is wrong. You are wise to consider other people's opinions, perspectives, and viewpoints, but in the end you have to make the choice that's right for you. Some outsiders might be worried that you're changing too much, and they might need a signal from you that confirms that you're still hanging tough.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 16, 2020:</span> Every relationship involves a balance of power, but it's important that you not confuse balancing power with fighting for control. Not every compromise has to be about someone giving up what they want for the sake of what someone else wants. When you and a friend or your partner are at loggerheads, don't assume that the winner takes it all. You can come to an agreement about what you both want, and then together the two of you can plan out how you're going to get it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 16, 2020:</span> This is the kind of day that the introverted part of your personality loves! You could be experiencing the perfect combination of flexible schedule, positive energy, and an urge for self-indulgence, setting the stage for some quality seclusion. You don't have to entertain anyone else, anticipate their needs, or try to be sociable when you're just not feeling it. Instead, spend as much of your time alone as you want. Being by yourself will enable you to do whatever you want to do, whenever you want to do it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 16, 2020:</span> Socially, your life may be about to get a lot busier! You're loved by all your friends, and they want to spend more time with you. One of them could have an exciting idea for a group vacation or excursion that might worry you a bit, but you should jump at the chance to spend some time with your favorite people! Close quarters will be full of fun, not conflict, so consider sharing a room to save on costs. This is a chance to have a great time, so run with it!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 16, 2020:</span> It's time to stop thinking so long and hard about what you want to say! Sometimes being spontaneous is the only way you can initiate something new and exciting. Whether it's introducing yourself to a hottie at the gym or grabbing the seat next to the big boss at lunch so you can get in some face time, you need to act now to get what you want. Waiting for someone else to come to you just isn't going to work right now. If you want it, you have to grab it!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 16, 2020:</span> You might not be able to get along with everyone as well as you'd like to right now, but there won't be any real fights. The social harmony will still be there, but there could be one or two people who rub you the wrong way. Unfortunately, you won't have time to address these issues as thoroughly as you'd like because you can't let your personal issues conflict with your business or educational goals. You have to ignore these people and just keep on moving forward.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 16, 2020:</span> If someone has owed you money (or something else) for too long, you need to speak up. Thinking about what others owe you without asking them for it will only increase the amount of stress you feel and add negative energy to the relationships you have with those people. There is a distinct possibility that someone has merely forgotten all about a debt. Remind them of it today. You have every right to, and they might be very grateful that you did.</p>
