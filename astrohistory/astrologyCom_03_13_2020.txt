<p><span class="date">Mar 13, 2020:</span> The amount of work you put into something is directly proportional to the quality of said work, so try not to cut any corners today. Give yourself all the time you need so you won't rush and miss some very urgent details. Be thorough with everything you do—spell-check every e-mail before sending it, and make sure you've returned all important phone calls by the middle of the day. Leaving too many questions unanswered will cause someone's imagination to spin in a weird direction.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 13, 2020:</span> Sometimes solitude is a luxury, and you might have to sacrifice some of yours today. Your presence is in high demand. People want you, left, right and center. Whether they want you to help explain something or they need you to sell a complicated idea to someone in power, you're in demand. Toss shyness by the wayside and step into the spotlight before someone else (less talented) beats you to the punch. Keep your vision simple and your words clear.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 13, 2020:</span> Someone who's pulling an "aw, shucks" attitude around you is full of beans, although you don't have to call them on it if you don't feel like it. Sometimes it's a lot more entertaining to watch people dig their own hole and then try to climb out of it. You can rest easy today knowing that your reputation is unimpeachable. You have nothing to worry about right now (unlike some other people). Go ahead and have a little fun feeling superior.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 13, 2020:</span> Things are improving in your work or school life. You're taking more initiative and letting your curiosity lead you in new directions. You're not taking no for an answer, nor should you. In conversations today, fill up the empty spaces with more questions—five minutes of inquisition can uncover a lifetime of new directions to explore. The outdoors will hold a strong appeal for you, too, as it serves to relax and invigorate you.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 13, 2020:</span> Your heart has been sending you in the right direction, but now it's time for you to let your gray matter weigh in on the current situation. It's not that emotions aren't important elements in your life—they are—but right now you need to think more logically than emotionally. Make a list of the pros and cons, research all your options, and give yourself plenty of time to make the right move. If you go just from your gut, you could end up making a mistake.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 13, 2020:</span> Moving from place to place will be effortless for you. You are in an extremely flexible phase right now, and to top it off, the universe is moving in such a way that all the pieces are falling into place right where you need them. The road ahead will appear just as you approach it, so there might be a bit of faith and positive thinking required to help keep you calm and confident through a couple of uncertain or slightly tense moments.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 13, 2020:</span> Pull back your focus a little bit. You may only be seeing one small aspect of a huge (and growing) situation. What you think is a potentially drastic problem is really nothing to get worked up about. What you may not realize is that other people are involved, and they've been doing a killer job of holding up their end of things. If you step back and look at the big picture, it will become immediately apparent that not everything has been resting on your shoulders. You can let go a bit.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 13, 2020:</span> As illogical as it sounds, a heavy mood can be lightened by heavy thoughts. If you face whatever is troubling you head-on and process it with as much honesty as you can, your worries will eventually fade away to nothing. But if you ignore the fact that something is wrong in your life, these issues aren't going anywhere! They'll stick around, waiting to get some of your attention—and they'll be there for as long as it takes. Think things through now and you'll feel better later.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 13, 2020:</span> It's funny how someone can say something that is fairly meaningless to them but acts as a huge trigger for you. A casual comment could remind you of something you've forgotten to do or make you rethink something you already did. Make the effort to stop what you're doing. Go back to double-check things to make sure all is okay. It could be as silly as leaving a light on or as critical as forgetting to make a payment, but you owe it to yourself to confirm it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 13, 2020:</span> If you think you can fake it when it comes to an intimidating situation, you're way off base! You can't bluff your way through things right now, so don't try. It's wisest if you just admit to any anxieties or insecurities you have up front. If you let everyone involved know that you feel like a fish out of water, they'll respect you for it. A mark of intelligence is knowing when you don't know something—and admitting it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 13, 2020:</span> A trendy hot spot might not seem the best place to get a new business venture started, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try. Merging personal and professional lives is not an easy feat for most people, but your consistent behavior makes it a breeze for you. You can see what needs to be done to make the deal happen, and your ideas will help make things better for everyone (not just for you). You're thinking generously and your ideas are bright.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 13, 2020:</span> Gambling doesn't always have to involve money. Beating the odds isn't always about having the best hand or picking the right sequence of numbers—it's all about exceeding expectations! Take a chance and go for a bold move at school, at work, or in a relationship. Don't behave the way other people expect you to. Act out of character. Go for a much more aggressive move than you normally would. Keep them guessing and you'll keep them interested.</p>
