<p><span class="date">Apr 1, 2020:</span> Putting restrictions on yourself isn't fun, but it's a heck of a great way to strengthen your values. Make sure that your actions are following your principles today. You have to walk the walk, not just talk the talk. It's not always easy to be consistent, but it's necessary if you want to be a person that people admire. Being a hypocrite is a lot easier, but who likes a hypocrite? And don't forget that you're a role model for others. Take this responsibility seriously.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 1, 2020:</span> You can't always choose the most entertaining option, but you can always try to make something boring into something a lot more interesting. All it takes is a positive attitude and a little creativity. Stuck in a boring online meeting? Imagine the speaker dressed up like a clown. Still working on that tedious project? Pretend it's all part of an international plan to thwart evil spies. Spin an interesting tale in your head to keep yourself engaged when reality just isn't cutting it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 1, 2020:</span> You could be working with a lot more energy than other people have today, so you need to be prepared to wait for them. This isn't good news if you depend on others for your own progress, but you won't be able to speed anyone up, so don't waste your time trying. Even though patience doesn't always come easy for you, you'll find that you'll get more and more comfortable cooling your heels while other people try to catch up as the day goes on.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 1, 2020:</span> Today, everyone could be looking to you to get things started. You might not be used to being the person who initiates the big plan, but you'll have to step up to it this time. Everyone else will be too focused on their own issues. This could actually turn out to be a good thing—they may not have very strong opinions about the ideas you have, so you might be able to do whatever you feel like! Put the emphasis on having fun.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 1, 2020:</span> Good manners have always helped you get along with people who other people find rude or otherwise annoying. This has been a bit of a curse from time to time, like when you get stuck talking to them at a party when you'd rather be chatting up that cutie across the room. But all of this kindness has been helping you rack up some serious karma points. Do beware of getting stuck in this system. It's time to transition out of being friendly to everyone. It's just not necessary anymore.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 1, 2020:</span> It's a great day for working on plans, especially if they're related to travel in any way. Go ahead and plan your itinerary or sign paperwork that needs to be signed. You're ready to go, so get this show on the road! The era of uncertainty you've been struggling with is over. And if any more information happens to come to light over the next few weeks, it shouldn't affect anything to a great degree. It's time to move forward decisively.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 1, 2020:</span> How would you describe your relationship with food? Are you a junk food junkie? Someone who claims to be allergic to vegetables? If so, no wonder you feel tired all the time! Food is the fuel for your body, and the quality of fuel dictates the quality of your physical being. Make more of an effort to eat better. It's not about your weight; it's about your health! Vegetables are delicious—are you eating enough of them? Skip the take-out. Opt for home-cooked meals instead.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 1, 2020:</span> If you're involved in any kind of competition today, be advised that your opponent may be a stronger force than you. This isn't a fun fact to contemplate, but it's one you must consider as you map out your day. Smart people win, but smarter people have backup plans in case they lose. Overlooking the possibility of failure is not only arrogant, it's unproductive. You need to be ready to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and figure out how you're going to prevail next time.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 1, 2020:</span> Sometimes it's easier to forget than forgive, so if you're struggling with someone who wronged you, it might be time for you to move on without them in your life. If you focus on the smaller issues that have been cropping up repeatedly between you two, you'll see that they're merely symptoms of a much bigger issue that is probably insurmountable. Communicate with this person today and let them know what you've been thinking about. See what they say.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 1, 2020:</span> The more time you can spend with children or teenagers today the better. Younger people understand that anything is possible, and that is an attitude that you need to have right now. When did you get so jaded, by the way? Babysit younger siblings or relatives. Being around people who have an optimistic and naive outlook on life will give you a fresh, new perspective, which in turn will give you a clearer sense of what you want.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 1, 2020:</span> Your mind could be sharper than ever today, which means that you'll be able to pick up anything quickly. All you have to do is take one glance at the instructions and you'll be good to go! Learning will not only easy be for you today, but it will also be a ton of fun! It's a perfect time for any schoolwork or research. And if you're curious about a new hobby or sport, why not find out how you can try it?</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 1, 2020:</span> You may need to give some very important and tricky advice to a friend, but you know just how to give it in a very sweet, soft, and supportive way, so don't worry. If it were anyone else doling out the advice, they wouldn't be able to get the message across without hurting someone's feelings or sounding judgmental. But you have the wonderful combination of compassion and honesty necessary to be helpful without being hurtful. Trust yourself. You know what to say.</p>
