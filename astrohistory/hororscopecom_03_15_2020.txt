<p><strong>Mar 15, 2020</strong> - Work could be a real drag today, Leo. You might be expected to put in more hours than normal. Your heart isn't in it right now.

<p><strong>Mar 15, 2020</strong> - Body and soul might seem out of balance today. A part of you may long to break from society and live a more spiritual life, but worldly responsibilities and an attachment to your current lifestyle could get in your way. These things don't happen overnight, Virgo. You have to let them develop in their own way, in their own time. Right now, find balance between the spiritual and the material.</p>

Perhaps people are disagreeing over what needs to be done regarding fundraising or budgetary limitations. It's best to divorce yourself from this sort of thing if possible, Libra. It's draining. Strange, vivid dreams might haunt your sleep tonight, but don't read too much into them. They aren't the kind with any special significance.</p>
