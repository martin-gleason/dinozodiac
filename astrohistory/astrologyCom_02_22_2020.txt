<p><span class="date">Feb 22, 2020:</span> Tell your inner critic to be extra kind when you're evaluating other people today. It can be quite demanding sometimes, and having high expectations is not going to help you get important people on your side, and you definitely need them to be on your side right now! There are many more ways of doing things than you realize, so keep an open mind and listen to what people are saying. It's time for you to let someone else teach you something for a change.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 22, 2020:</span> You'll want to be especially careful to keep all of your communication on the up-and-up right now. The more honest and open you can be with people the better. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that if you tell someone what you think they want to hear that they'll like you better or respect you more. That is less true than you realize. It's much better to be direct and blunt with your criticism than to sugarcoat everything you say. Don't worry, they can handle it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 22, 2020:</span> Your interpersonal energy might feel a bit off at the moment, so don't be surprised if some of your interactions (especially the romantic kind) take sudden strange turns. Just try to laugh off a misspoken comment or awkward silence. The other person will follow your lead most likely. Think of this as a great opportunity for you to practice making lemonade out of lemons! Prove to yourself that you can turn something negative into a positive.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 22, 2020:</span> You'll be getting a much more profound understanding of an issue (or a certain someone) that has been causing you to scratch your head in confusion lately. An unusual event later in the day could reveal what's really going on and what you can do to help move things in a more positive direction. You have a lot more control over what can happen now, and it's about time that you realized it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 22, 2020:</span> It's time for you to realize that being self-centered isn't always a bad thing. Sometimes it's essential in order to keep your cool. Today, you need to concentrate on number one (that's you!) in order to stay happy and grounded. Treat yourself right and make some big plans. Buy something you've had your eye on. Watch that epic movie you've never had time to watch. Whether it's a big thing or a small thing, do it for yourself!</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 22, 2020:</span> If you're still holding on to some hurt feelings or leftover issues from your past, today is the day to move past them. They're clouding your thoughts and causing you to think things about someone in your life right now that simply aren't true. Are you judging someone based on the actions of someone else? This person's role in your life is potentially very important, so you need to spend time with them today and give them the chance to show you who they really are.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 22, 2020:</span> Money is probably on your mind more than just about anything else right now, and it could be distracting you too much from friends and family members. To take your mind off of finances, focus on someone else's life. Single out a fun friend and ask them how their job or love life is going. Get them talking about themselves so you won't have to think so much about what is going on in your life. Give yourself a vacation from your worries for a day.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 22, 2020:</span> Someone in your family might not know the full story about what is going on with you right now, but that's probably not going to stop them from lecturing you about it. As much as it might annoy you to listen to what they have to say, you must. They might not be on target with what they are talking about, but they love you, and listening to what they think is a good way to show them that you love them right back. Besides, there will be more than a few gems of wisdom in what they tell you.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 22, 2020:</span> Just what are you waiting for? That job, cutie, or other exciting new opportunity isn't going to come to you. You have to go to it. It's time to get proactive and go after what you want! So cross that room and talk to that alluring person before someone else gets to them first. Tell your boss you're interested in the job before they start interviewing other candidates. The universe can't help you get what you want until you take that first step.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 22, 2020:</span> A little bit of solo time probably sounds good to you right now, doesn't it? It makes sense, after all the time and energy you've been giving to other people lately. A little bit of rest and relaxation will revitalize your heart and your soul and remind those around you that you can't be taken for granted. You are there to help, not there to be used. Treat yourself well and get all the beauty sleep you feel you need right now.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 22, 2020:</span> Details, details. Sure, they're not the most exciting things in the world, but they're vitally important to maintaining one of your most precious relationships today. Have you forgotten someone's birthday or neglected to congratulate someone on their diet progress? Noticing the little things and commenting upon them will show the other people in your life that you care. You can't put yourself on autopilot when it comes to friendships.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 22, 2020:</span> Today, some conflict could grow between the side of you that wants to take on greater responsibility and the side of you that just wants to have fun. This doesn't have to be a tug of war, though. You can have it both ways! All you need to do is organize your day a bit better and you'll be able to enjoy yourself without letting other people down. Schedule your day in 15-minute increments if you have to.</p>
