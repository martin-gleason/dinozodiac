<p><strong>Mar 26, 2020</strong> - The planetary energy makes this a good day for contemplation rather than action, Taurus. If you feel the urge to buy, don't. Sleep on decisions. If you feel the same tomorrow, go for it. If you're in the middle of a conflict at work, try not to take sides. Tell anyone who asks your opinion that you need time to think about it. Consider scheduling an hour of meditation. The word for today is Zen!</p>

<p><strong>Mar 26, 2020</strong> - This may be a tricky day, Sagittarius, as you feel the pull of conflicting demands and desires.

<p><strong>Mar 26, 2020</strong> - It doesn't seem fair that your workload has increased these last few days. Never mind that you still have all of your normal tasks to do, your boss expects you to finalize a new budget and write a proposal as well? Enlist the help of others if you can. If you can't, simply do the best you can without sacrificing time with your family and loved ones. Ultimately, Capricorn, the latter is more important.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 26, 2020</strong> - You've been extremely busy these past few months, working extra hours at the office, then going out with friends late at night. This sort of behavior is known as "burning the candle at both ends," and it rarely has a happy ending, Aquarius. You need to take some quiet time, ideally with someone special. It's likely that your romantic partner misses you and would jump at the opportunity to spend an intimate evening with you.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 26, 2020</strong> - Expect today's planetary energies to raise your social consciousness, Pisces. You may be distracted with thoughts of the homeless person you saw today, or the television special you saw on babies with AIDS. You may be reflecting on your connection to and responsibilities toward humanity. Why don't you put aside a little time or money for the charity of your choice? If you're feeling these urges, don't hesitate to act on them!</p>
