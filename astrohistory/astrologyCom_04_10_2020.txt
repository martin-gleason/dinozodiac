<p><span class="date">Apr 10, 2020:</span> Today, it's not about figuring out what other people can do to make you happy. It's not even about figuring out what you can do to make yourself happy. It's about figuring out what you can do to make others happy! Be of service to someone who needs a hand. Send a sad friend into giggle fits, come to the aid of an overworked colleague, or just surrender a parking space to a tired-looking mom. Doing something nice for someone else will help you feel good about yourself in a whole new way.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 10, 2020:</span> There is a lot of love swirling around you today, so why don't you reach out and get some of it for yourself? You deserve it. Start showing yourself the affection you want other people to show you, in whatever way you feel is appropriate. Buy yourself a nice present, make yourself out a great dinner, or give yourself a real spa facial. You can't rely on other people to pamper you—it's not realistic. If you deserve it, you should do it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 10, 2020:</span> Talking and socializing could take up a lot of your day. You'll get a huge kick out of chitchat with your friends. Today, it's all about who has a crush on whom, what the hottest new trend is, and where everyone is hanging out. Sure, it might not be the most compelling or important stuff there is to talk about, but it adds a nice balance to your life, which recently has been filled with too many heavy issues.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 10, 2020:</span> A very small detail could derail some of your plans today. But that doesn't mean you should be paranoid about every little thing you encounter throughout the course of the day (that'd be pretty exhausting). Rather, just be aware that this slipup may occur. You can't make everything perfect even on the best of days, so don't waste your time trying. Just stay limber and be ready with a backup plan in case things do go awry.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 10, 2020:</span> It might feel like pulling teeth to get a friend to join in on your latest idea, but it will be worth all the effort you put in. This pal needs to be advised about what to do next and will be flattered by your attention. You're ready to be more spontaneous, and a few of your friends really need to be a bit more impulsive, too. A few encouraging words will be all it takes! Appeal to their imaginations and paint a picture of the best-case scenario.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 10, 2020:</span> While today won't offer any exceptional achievements, it could definitely set the stage for them. Think of this as a final round of auditions in which you're sure to move forward to the next stage in whatever competition you're in. Although you'll have to wait a little bit longer for that sweet, rewarding sound of applause, you should take comfort in the fact that you got where you are through hard work and honesty. Your past achievements have earned you your spot!</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 10, 2020:</span> Pay close attention to any feedback you're given today. It will be highly perceptive and extremely accurate. The more off base it seems, the more on target it actually is. It's time to be a bit more obedient and a bit less wildly independent. When you follow someone else's guidance in the right way at the right time, you can reap a big payoff! Today is the right time, so listen and take heed.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 10, 2020:</span> Planning can be a lot of fun for you today, especially if the details involved are small ones. Dates, names, times, and other facts are fluttering all around you today, but you'll wrangle them with ease. This is the perfect day to move forward on future travel, meeting, or party plans because you'll finally get all the information you need from all the people involved. Answers abound. All you have to do is spend a little extra time to find them.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 10, 2020:</span> Some good news could send your mood skyrocketing! A green light is shining brightly, letting you know that things are looking good and you're clear for takeoff! But before you head for the wild blue yonder, make sure you're wearing your safety belt. Now is not the time to rush ahead and forget to cover all the important details. You're capable of soaring to great heights, but first you have to make sure your feet are planted firmly on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 10, 2020:</span> Make sure you do your research today. Knowing the ins and outs will put you ahead of the game. If you've got a job interview, find out what the company is all about and you'll wow them with the fact that you made this extra effort. The same thing applies if you've met someone on a dating app. Learn a little more about the other person's interests and hobbies. It will make the conversation go much more smoothly and make you look like the most charming person on earth (which of course, you are, at least today)!</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 10, 2020:</span> By surrounding yourself with people who are more grounded than you are right now, you'll slowly become much more grounded yourself. Today, try to reach out to people who are always cool, calm, and collected even in the midst of chaos. These are the people who can teach you how to eliminate the extraneous from your life, as well as how to see things as they truly are. Just picking their brains could teach you all you need to know.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 10, 2020:</span> Be extremely careful about the people you get involved with right now, especially when it comes to business dealings. Do you really know who you're dealing with? These people aren't revealing enough about themselves, and there is a reason that they're being so mysterious. If you take the time to look at things objectively, you will quickly see that you don't have all the information you need to make the right choices or investments, no matter how confident you feel.</p>
