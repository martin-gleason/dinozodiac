<p><span class="date">Feb 21, 2020:</span> You always have time to learn new things, so even if your day is jam-packed, you should reserve at least a minute or two to explore! Check out that new restaurant, go for a drive in a different part of town, or pick up a book about something or someone you've never heard of before. Someone will want you to take off with them on a new adventure that sounds like fun. If you think you can squeeze it into your day, you definitely should!</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 21, 2020:</span> If you're about to come to a crossroads in your life, you should take the road that your mind, not your emotions, tells you is the right one. Right now, your feelings are a bit too confused to be good indicators. Your financial worries could soon be a thing of the past, thanks to the generosity of someone close to you. You could be given a real opportunity for career advancement, although it's going to be contingent upon a long-term commitment. There is no such thing as an easy reward.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 21, 2020:</span> Your usual partners in crime might not be as ready to move on to the next social escapade as you are, so what are your options? You can sit on your hands and wait for them to catch up to you, or you can go ahead and take action by yourself. This might be a good time to try things on your own for a while. You've got the drive, you've got the energy, and you've got the ideas. Plus, your friends will be there waiting if you need any backup down the line.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 21, 2020:</span> People will be falling all over each other to be of service to you today, so much so that you might start feeling like royalty! Will you be a kind ruler or a ruthless one? The choice is, as always, up to you. But keep in mind that you might not always be the one sitting on the throne. Someday, it will be you down there kissing someone else's ring. How would you like to be treated then? Be generous with your praise and never take a helping hand for granted.</p>

Delightful coincidences could make you feel more alive than ever before, and that apple of your eye is feeling frisky. A gift or two is in the cards for you, and it will likely come from your main squeeze, who wants you to know how much brighter you make their world. Express your emotions, too. Don't be afraid to say those sweet words.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 21, 2020:</span> The road ahead of you is in a state of unrest right now. There is a lot that still needs to be decided, and those choices have to be made by other people. If you rush forward and just hope for the best, you might be adding more chaos to your life than necessary. Wait until the uncertainty fades and you have a clearer picture of where you need to go. The future is something you should enter with a clear understanding about what you're setting yourself up for.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 21, 2020:</span> It's a very good thing that you're still exploring all your options right now, because you have to be patient with the learning curve. New facts and details are still dribbling out, so don't get discouraged if you aren't getting the answers you want right now. The success of your latest endeavor depends on other people just as much as it depends on you, so you have to wait for them to catch up with you. Half of the situation is out of your control, so don't take on the whole burden.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 21, 2020:</span> Today, the conditions are absolutely perfect for you to make a bold romantic move, take a risky business leap, or tell that certain person what you've been wanting to tell them for a very long time. Hesitation and fear are things of the past, the distant past. Unless you act decisively today, you could run the risk of missing out on building something special between you and someone else. It takes guts to take the leap, but you've got courage in spades!</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 21, 2020:</span> There is turmoil in one of your friendships, but don't worry too much about it. This person is going through a lot of uncertainty in their life, and there isn't anything you can do to help. The fact that their problems are affecting your relationship is something you should make them aware of, but don't blame them for it. Just let them know that you're there for them if and when they need you. They'll be back soon, and they'll be grateful for your patience.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 21, 2020:</span> Have you been contemplating taking on the role of matchmaker? You should. Two people in your life need to get together, and you might be just the person to help make it happen! You can't worry about getting in the middle of anything. You're already in the middle! See what you can do to be the mediator between them. They both have a couple of long-lost connections that you can bring up when the time is right.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 21, 2020:</span> If you're feeling a little more outgoing than usual today, it's going to definitely work in your favor. It's an expansive day, when an open mind and free attitude will treat you to many possibilities and positive attention. Things you never noticed before are suddenly popping up in front of you, capturing your imagination and giving you few ideas about how to make some changes in your life. This is a great day to launch any new plans. Your enthusiasm will be contagious.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 21, 2020:</span> Try to adopt a "keep it to yourself" attitude about controversies today. Play it safe, because it's quite likely that your boss or another authority figure will have different opinions than you do. It's best to just button your lip and bite your tongue. This person isn't interested in starting a debate about what whether you're right or they're right. They need you to just go along with them and not make any waves. And for today, there's absolutely nothing wrong with doing just that.</p>
