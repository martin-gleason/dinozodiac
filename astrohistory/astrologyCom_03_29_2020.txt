<p><span class="date">Mar 29, 2020:</span> Ambition is a powerful and positive force, but it has had too much control over your life lately. Today, it's time to hop off the career ladder. Stop working so hard to move yourself upward. Instead, let the events of the day carry you along. By the end of the day, you could find that you like where you've ended up. Balance is important in every aspect of your life, so start paying more attention to fun, frivolity, and friendships.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 29, 2020:</span> Moving forward in your life is rewarding and exciting, but you do get a little bit older every day. And aging is aging. Your body may be suddenly revealing its vulnerabilities. First of all, don't panic! If you're feeling more aches or pains, don't ignore them. Taking care of any health concerns should be your top priority, whether that means making a doctor's appointment or ordering a sandwich on whole wheat bread instead of white. You could end up being better off than before.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 29, 2020:</span> Are you suddenly itching to try something new? It's not surprising. The universe is sending you some incredibly potent wanderlust right now, and you'll be dying to get out into the world and explore! If foreign travel isn't feasible for you in the near future, you can be content simply exploring a new part of town, a new type of music, or even a new type of cuisine. It's time for some serious stimulation and moving beyond the familiar.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 29, 2020:</span> You could wake up with a lot of energy. You'll probably want to hit the ground running! But to be safe, hold off until later in the day before charging full steam ahead. Conserve your energy and go through this day in a smart way. Be cool, calm, and collected. If you just bust out of the gate, arms flailing, you could scare people with all that erratic energy. Other folks need time to prepare for your onslaught of eagerness, and you can afford to give it to them.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 29, 2020:</span> One of the many good things about having so many people in your life right now is that you always have tons of feedback available at your fingertips. Why aren't you taking advantage of this plethora of honesty? Reaching out for others' opinions isn't a sign that you don't know what to do. It's proof that you value what the people in your life think. Integrating their ideas and listening without criticism is something they appreciate.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 29, 2020:</span> Someone is going to get what they want by appealing to your analytical side today, but you may find yourself buying their argument emotionally as well. Today could be the beginning of a shift in your perception. You're much more willing to see the other side of arguments and let people slide on the silly stuff. You're mellowing out, and the people around you are feeling more comfortable presenting new ideas and getting you involved in their mental adventures.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 29, 2020:</span> Age or appearance may set you apart today, but it won't negatively affect how much respect you'll get, so don't let anything put a damper on your positive attitude. You need to stay objective and calm. When you keep things strictly business, you'll have a better chance of being treated fairly. Share too much about why you feel the way you do, and you may provide the excuse someone's looking for. Expect a good reception and an invitation to become more involved.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 29, 2020:</span> Your urge to protect someone gets stronger when you witness an unacceptable exchange. Be careful how you approach the situation, and try not to let your emotions get the better of you. A well-placed word at the right time will mean more than anything. If you run headfirst into conflict and try to make peace with everyone, you'll only end up being frustrated. Respect other people's arguments, and take note of the behavior of the individuals.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 29, 2020:</span> Harmony happens in more places than just songs, although wherever it appears it's beautiful. Multiple voices singing the same song are much more beautiful when one or two of those voices are singing different notes. Merely having everyone saying exactly the same thing in exactly the same tone isn't enough, and you recognize that. If you encourage individuality today, you can be a part of something beautiful and memorable.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 29, 2020:</span> You could be making plenty of connections today, and each of them could plant a seed in your life. There is strong potential for a new career opportunity, although it may take weeks, if not months, to come together. The person you like the most could get a lot friendlier, but it might not be for the reason you think. It's important to let your outgoing nature guide you today, because it will help you know who you need to meet most and ensure you're introduced.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 29, 2020:</span> Look at the world around you honestly, and see the truth about where you live. Witnessing the plight of people who are less fortunate might bring up a few pangs of paralyzing guilt, but ultimately your compassion will take over. You're inspired to do something. Your heart will push you to get involved in helping your community become a more supportive, welcoming place, and don't be surprised if you meet up with a kindred spirit in the midst of all that altruism.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 29, 2020:</span> An innocent mix-up between a couple of your friends is starting to snowball. If you aren't careful, you could get caught up in the avalanche. Be very careful not to give the impression that you have chosen sides, even if you feel strongly that one person is in the right. You have to give the impression of objectivity, even if you don't feel objective. Stay as detached as possible and let them figure out how to come to terms.</p>
