<p><span class="date">Mar 21, 2020:</span> Surprises await you when you go out exploring, whether you take a walk around the neighborhood or book a transcontinental flight! Your brain is starving for new stimulation, and the best way to find it is to put yourself in a situation that's foreign to you—the more foreign the better. Bonus points for language barriers! When you're out of your element, your creativity really sparkles. You can communicate with anyone, and it will be a huge boost to your ego.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 21, 2020:</span> Remember that all that glitters is not gold, and taking people at their word isn't always a wise thing to do. Some people are definitely going to just tell you what you want to hear. In order to make sure you hear the truth, you have to keep them guessing about what it is you want. Keep your cards close to your chest. Don't give any clues about what the correct answers might be. Be critical, be objective, and be skeptical.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 21, 2020:</span> Is something just not working out in one of your newer relationships? Miscommunication, misunderstandings, and inconsiderate actions may have helped build quite a wall between you two, and you need to address the situation today. Don't dwell on what has happened. Focus more on the reason you chose to be in each other's life to begin with. Has that reason changed? If so, it might be time for you to move on. Friendships don't always have to last forever.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 21, 2020:</span> Torn between two friendships? You've got plenty of room in your life for both of these people. You just have to figure out how to make it work. They each offer you something that the other doesn't, which could be a big part of the reason they don't exactly get along with each other. Don't feel like you need to make a choice. If one of them issues an ultimatum, push right back. Ask them how they'd feel if they had to choose who they can and can't have in their life.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 21, 2020:</span> Someone in your life could be grumpy today, and they're ready to find someone to blame for it. Don't let that person be you! Steer clear of anyone whose attitude isn't to your liking right now, and find any excuse you can to remove yourself from their glare. You aren't usually bothered by this kind of pettiness, but this person could really put you over the edge. Don't sweat your sensitivity. Just leave them alone. Focus on taking care of your own good mood. Keep smiling.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 21, 2020:</span> You could be wrong about someone today. Your idea of who they are isn't accurate any more, and you're missing out on knowing a wonderful person. Force yourself to talk to someone you don't like very much. There is no doubt that within a few minutes you'll learn that they're a lot cooler than you thought they were. Give them a chance. If you don't, you're not only selling them short, but you're selling yourself short, too.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 21, 2020:</span> Your brain is hungry for new stimulation. So what are you planning to do about it? The normal routine will be a total snooze-fest, so you'll have to do some exploring to find something titillating enough to capture your attention and imagination. Go places where you don't know anyone. Say hi, and remind yourself how good you are at breaking the ice. Talk to people you'd never usually talk to, and they'll remind you how rewarding it is to take a chance on an unknown.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 21, 2020:</span> Today, everyone around you could be controlled by their unpredictable emotions. You need to keep your distance from all the drama. Try not to get caught up in the moment. What you do in a split second now could have ramifications that negatively affect your life for several days. Be cautious around new people, especially those whose opinions could directly influence your life. It's best to keep quiet, stay calm, and keep a smile on your face!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 21, 2020:</span> Let your generosity and compassion play a major role in any type of bargaining you do today. You can't focus so intently on how much you give others in the context of a negotiation. If you do, you'll always feel like you're on the losing end of the deal. Instead, focus on the connection you're enjoying with this person. Work toward having a future with them in some way. If you do, the goodwill you exhibit will be far surpassed by the goodwill you gain from others.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 21, 2020:</span> You've been thinking that a conversation with a difficult person won't go well, but if you have that talk today, you could be pleasantly surprised by the results. This person is totally ready to talk to you and ready to work with you to make things better. A lot of positive collaboration is possible, especially if you reach out and show that you're willing to do what it takes to make progress. The situation will only improve if you persevere, so keep talking!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 21, 2020:</span> Words convey feelings, but there is nothing like physical contact to make a connection. If you're working on building a romantic relationship, try to work in a bit more touch. Greet them with a hug, tap them on the shoulder, or even dare to hold their hand. Whatever small move you make in the physical realm could generate a huge impact in the emotional realm. Show them how you feel in addition to telling them how you feel.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 21, 2020:</span> Your urge to get closer to someone in your social circle is almost unbearable. But before moving forward, pay closer attention to the clues they send. They could be quite mixed! This person might not be quite ready to open up to you. To test the waters, keep your conversation light. Resist any urge to ask them to spend the rest of their life with you! Baby steps will get you closer to their heart than giant leaps—and they're a lot less intimidating.</p>
