Even if you don't get out of the preliminary planning stages, you'll still be well positioned for a successful outcome.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 9, 2020:</span> Are you ready for a progress report? It's good news! You're looking very good. You're one step closer to a bright existence and miles away from the unproductive habits of your past. It's a good day to look in the mirror and flash yourself a great big smile, then give yourself a nice pat on the back. Treating yourself to a great dinner, new pair of shoes, or cool gadget isn't out of the question. You deserve it!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 9, 2020:</span> The role that money plays in your life is going through a transition, and it's beginning to seem like there are a few things in the world that are more important than account balances and shiny new things. Material goods are losing their luster, and your eye is being drawn to humbler objects. Other people in your life might be confused by your new focus. This change in your attitude could cause a wrinkle in your social life for a little while, but only until everyone adjusts.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 9, 2020:</span> Some people may accept things at face value, but not you! You're much too intellectually curious to buy into the latest craze, so don't worry that you're out of sync with others. If you just don't get it, you probably aren't missing a thing. Fads come and go, but your own interests are going to be staying the same for a while. Devote some time to your favorite hobby or sport today. It will remind you of what you're good at and give you a nice boost of high energy and attitude.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 9, 2020:</span> Why be shy about how you feel? It's always a good time to show your affection for someone else. Even if you barely know somebody but you like the spark in their eye, let 'em know! Give out hugs like they're free lollipops, and plant a nice, juicy kiss on your partner as soon as you see them today. Words are important, but it's the sweet little gestures of affection—the hugs, the hand holding, and even the shoulder squeezes—that confirm the connection.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 9, 2020:</span> When you help out other people today, you'll actually be helping yourself. Surrender that excellent parking space to someone else, and you'll probably end up finding an even better one later in the day. Lend someone some money for lunch, and someone else could appear with a very special treat for you. Karma is all about the good energy you put out coming back to you. Think of other people today, and you'll be putting yourself in a very good position for the future.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 9, 2020:</span> Fast thinking on your part could make all the difference today, so keep looking at things from different angles. Prepare a few suggestions just in case you're asked for your input. Try not to show your cards before the right time. You wouldn't want to share too much information and lose your competitive edge. It's time to closely guard your secrets. This might be against your generous nature, but it's in your best interests.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 9, 2020:</span> One of your oldest relationships may be reaching an important turning point. This is the time to admit that it's now or never and make the choice you've been afraid to make. You need to look out for yourself in this scenario and realize that your role in the partnership isn't just to do what they expect you to do all the time. Where is your piece of the pie? You can choose to have a last conversation on the topic, or you can choose to just let go and move on.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 9, 2020:</span> Today, stay loose and relaxed on the inside and composed and formal on the outside. The first impression you make is going to be key, and you'll want to err on the side of ambition. This combination of calm and cool can help you easily take advantage of a big opportunity when it appears. The work at hand demands a lot of you, but it's nothing you can't handle with grace and professionalism. Propriety and an objective demeanor will help you throughout the day.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 9, 2020:</span> There are two sides to every story, and two sides to every relationship. Today, pay close attention to every relationship you take part in, no matter how trivial. There is value in every exchange, whether it merely makes you feel good about yourself or uncovers a big clue you've been searching for. In a service context, you should unleash your most generous tendencies. Remember that a healthy tip now could ensure superior service in the future.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 9, 2020:</span> If you're involved in a task that isn't as easy as you thought it would be, good! That means you're on the right track. Challenges are the only thing in life that teach you just how capable you are of doing amazing things. They enable you to surprise yourself and impress others. It's a good thing to feel a bit in over your head once in a while. Resist the urge to take the easy way out. Go for broke and make this thing as wonderful as you know it can be.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 9, 2020:</span> It's all about endurance today. Can you sit through that boring meeting without falling asleep? Can you handle the traffic on your way home from work? Can you stick with your diet one more day? The answer to all of these questions is an enthusiastic yes! You have a big store of strength deep inside you, and you'll need to call on it today. You'll be able to entertain yourself, distract yourself, and provide yourself with an internal happy place to go to.</p>
