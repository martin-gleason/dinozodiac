<p><span class="date">Mar 20, 2020:</span> An unexpected encounter could spark the start of a new phase of stronger, more independent thought. You're not going to be as interested in joining a group of people as you are in exploring new hobbies, movies, and destinations on your own. The urge to go it alone might make you a little nervous, or even scared, but it will be welcome. You're looking for stimulation, and the kind of stimulation you get isn't necessarily as important as the way it makes you feel: inspired!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 20, 2020:</span> No matter how much pretty packaging you put around something, if it isn't for you, it isn't for you. Stop wasting time going with the trends. Give yourself permission to like what you like, and don't worry about what other people think. If you love your rainbow suspenders, wear them! If disco music is the only thing that gets you grooving, crank up the volume! Be proud of who you are, and be proud of all the things that set you apart from the rest of the world.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 20, 2020:</span> If you've been spending the past few days nursing a bruised ego, it's time to start shifting back into life. The best thing you can do for yourself is get back into the action and have some fun. You have a lot of beauty and strength to showcase, and there are plenty of people who want a front row seat to the show. There is more interest in you right now than you realize. You're missing an amazing opportunity by standing on the sidelines and watching others.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 20, 2020:</span> Do something for yourself today, and try to do it without feeling even an ounce of guilt! Sure, the time you spend taking a nap, shopping for a new pair of shoes, enjoying a leisurely lunch, or indulging in a massage could be better used listening to a friend's current troubles, helping them with a tough task, or cheering them on, but so what? All of those things can wait for another day. No one will feel abandoned or let down if you take care of yourself.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 20, 2020:</span> It's the ideas that are really out there that are the ones people will pay the most attention to right now, so think big—and outside the box! Whether you and your friends are trying to come up with a great plan for the weekend, you and your co-workers are trying to solve a complex business problem, or you and your partner are just trying to add some fire to your romance, let your imagination run wild. It could lead you to some very wonderful and unique places.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 20, 2020:</span> Your latest accomplishments give you permission to put up your feet, relax, and just go with the flow for a while, so why aren't you doing it? Don't push any further today, because you're in danger of running out of gas. Listen to your body and give it a rest. Continuing on at this pace will only deplete your energy and put you in poor shape for tomorrow. Check out of the world by late afternoon if you can, and hole up in a nice, quiet place.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 20, 2020:</span> Any strict regimen you've been on lately may have yielded some impressive results at work or school, but it's also left you with a lot less time to just relax and be you. Give yourself a bit of a break to slow down and enjoy the benefits of all your hard work. Spend some time on friends and some money on yourself! Isn't there something you've been wanting to do but haven't had the time? Make the time today. You'll be glad you did.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 20, 2020:</span> Some exciting news could come your way today, but it will have to be kept a secret. Try not to get caught up in the moment and talk about it to people who aren't in on the story. Just be your usual discreet self and move through your day without letting on about what you know. Being a trusted confidant is important, and proving yourself to be discreet could open the door to a whole new (and exciting) level to your career or social life.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 20, 2020:</span> People who seem quite cheerful and jovial initially could turn into some grumpy campers later in the day when a bit of unpleasant news hits the world around you. Be wary of folks whose smiles could be hiding some temper tantrums. It won't take a lot to send them over the edge, and you won't want to be around when that happens! Be cautious about anything that seems too nice, kind, or generous today. There are just too many uncertain elements at work.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 20, 2020:</span> Your view of life may have been centered around the glass being half empty for a while, but today a fresh, idealistic energy surrounds you and gives you hope. Also, you're surrounded by people who cherish you, and you should start relying on them more than you have been. They're in your life because they want to be there, so let them help you! They'll play a vital role in helping to turn your outlook into more of a glass-half-full one.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 20, 2020:</span> Be sure to warmly welcome new members to your group. You know all too well what it's like to be the new kid on the block, so you understand the power that a simple smile can wield. By positioning yourself as open and happy to see them, you'll be seen as a power player in the group, someone whose words carry weight. There's a lesson to learn about how creating friendships can help prevent conflicts in the future.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 20, 2020:</span> The day could start off incredibly smooth and easy, and a sweet gift may even land in your lap. Resist the urge to get too relaxed too soon, though, because there could be a lot of noise coming from the sidelines. Pay attention and take note of the complaints people have, but don't get sucked into any drama. Change can't happen overnight, so tell the whiners that they'll have to wait their turn like everyone else.</p>
