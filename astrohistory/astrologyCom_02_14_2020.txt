<p><span class="date">Feb 14, 2020:</span> Past mistakes or missteps are all water under the bridge. You can't just focus on them while you're thinking about what to do next. When embarking upon a new project, romance, or job, you have to have an open mind and a strong "anything is possible" attitude. Positive thinking will empower you and encourage you to take a chance where you might not have taken a chance before. Things need to be attempted in life even if they can't always be mastered.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 14, 2020:</span> Despite what some control freaks might tell you, there's real freedom in letting other people take over. Explore your more passive side today by handing the reins over to someone you trust. In a romantic relationship, let your partner choose your next date. In a friendship, ask your friends to plan the next event. What you'll find is that these people have great ideas! Letting go will take a weight off your shoulders and make you feel lighter overall.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 14, 2020:</span> You are well within your rights to put your own agenda first today, even if it means you cause conflict in a group setting. Getting along well with others should be a secondary goal today. After all, you can't always be everyone's friend, and debate can't always be fun. Don't compromise what you believe just to get along with the group more easily. Other people might give you grief for not just going along with the plan, but deep down they'll respect you for sticking to your guns.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 14, 2020:</span> There's a right time and a right place for being stingy with your money. Today will prove that to you. There's nothing wrong with being giving and generous, but your extravagant spirit is running the risk of putting your bank account in jeopardy! Cut out the unnecessary gifts for a while. Is it really necessary for you to pick up the tab every time you do a coffee run? Let someone else buy, and give them a chance to repay the favor.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 14, 2020:</span> Your growing confidence is quite a kick in the pants as far as your ego is concerned, but you should be careful not to get too cocky right now. Just because you have a proven record as a rock star doesn't mean you won't release a dud single once in a while. If you want to maintain your great reputation (and build on it), play things safe for a while. Don't make any bold moves or major proclamations. You might also want put on your politically correct hat for the day, just in case.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 14, 2020:</span> Today, things that normally bug you will drift right by without you even noticing. You're entering a very enriching period of reflection in your life, and this is distracting you from seeing much of the peripheral world. Your attention could be diverted throughout the day, so important meetings that require full concentration may not be a good idea. Don't make any commitments right now. You can't fully see the ramifications of what you're agreeing to.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 14, 2020:</span> Does a leader cease being a leader when no one is following? That's a good question for you to ponder today when your group's attitude might be bordering on mutinous. Instead of joining in on the grumbling about how no one knows what the heck is really going on, be more productive. Take over some of the leadership role and give people something—anything—to believe in. Just having a good attitude is a good start.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 14, 2020:</span> You've been running around so frenetically that you long ago missed out on the fact that you already tore through the finish line on that project or goal. Slow down today! There is no point in continuing on your path because everyone you wanted to impress has long since disappeared. Right now, you're only trying to impress yourself. This perfectionism isn't going to make you happier, so just take a break and relax. Give yourself time to notice the progress you've made.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 14, 2020:</span> Sometimes, when you're granted a wish, you don't always realize it right away. Something you've been waiting for could be coming your way, so you'd better open your eyes to see it. Dressed up in camouflage, it probably won't fit your physical ideal, but it's perfect for you. Any adjustments you need to make to accept it are worth making. Choices you made in a work or school environment are paying off now, and you'll soon be given a chance to enjoy an extended stay in luxurious surroundings.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 14, 2020:</span> Things are heating up in one of your relationships, and not in a good way. Instead of getting all hot and bothered, you're going to be getting hot under the collar. This is a time to work hard for a compromise, though. Don't hold on to your demands at the cost of harmony with this other person. You have to regard them as someone who is just as deserving as you are. Once this happens, the two of you will be much more capable of coming to terms with what has to happen next.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 14, 2020:</span> A boss or other authority figure could cause you some problems today. You might even have to put your personal life on hold for a few days to deal with a couple of these problems, and the person who's causing them. The good news is that these interruptions in your life's normally scheduled programming will ultimately generate more fun than stress and in the long run will offer you more opportunity than frustration. This is your time to shine brightly and promote yourself to people in power. This isn't an inconvenience; it's an open door.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 14, 2020:</span> If you've been experiencing any problems with your health lately, follow up with a doctor's appointment. This isn't necessarily an emergency situation. It's probably your subconscious reminding you that you need to take care of yourself! On that note, how are you doing as far as taking care of your emotional needs? There is no crime in saying no to a friend's invitation because you would rather spend some time alone, you know. Make you your number one priority.</p>
