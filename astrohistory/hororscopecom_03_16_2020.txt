<p><strong>Mar 16, 2020</strong> - Go ahead and make a list today, Aries. Powerful emotions are likely to lure you from your current path unless you have some sort of concrete plan to fall back on. Put idle hands to use by delegating tasks to the people around you. You'll be amazed at the little blocks of time you have when you stay on task and keep yourself and everyone else around you in motion.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 16, 2020</strong> - Be careful about becoming too stubborn today, Gemini. This is one of those days in which you're asked to build a structure in a very windy area. If you insist on using the most rigid materials, you'll find that the structure you build ends up snapping in two. If, however, you construct your building with flexible materials, it will bend in the wind and last far longer.</p>

Your adaptive powers could be put to the test as you find yourself surrounded by fickle emotions and stubborn attitudes. Don't get too hung up on getting straight answers from people today, for they're apt to be just as confused as you about certain issues. Play it cool for now and ride the waves easily to shore.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 16, 2020</strong> - You should be feeling emotionally strong today, Virgo, although you could find that an idea runs through your head that asks you to slow down and take things once step at a time. The internal dialogue could drive you crazy if you aren't careful. The most important thing to do now is simply follow your heart. Do what you love to do, and associate with the people you love and respect the most.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 16, 2020</strong> - You may find that your heart is bouncing back and forth like a tennis ball today, Sagittarius. One minute you could be drawn one way, while the next minute you're drawn in a completely different direction. Instead of trying to fight this feeling, take advantage of it.

<p><strong>Mar 16, 2020</strong> - Your energy level is high today, Capricorn, but don't let this turn into a head-in-the-clouds attitude. Keep one foot firmly planted on the ground, because you may need to keep a level head in a work or personal situation. Keep in mind that the best way to deal with this is to use your positive energy to heal the difficult situation instead of letting this difficult situation get you down.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 16, 2020</strong> - You could think that your life is too boring for anyone else to care about, Aquarius. Don't fall into a well of self-pity and convince yourself that there simply isn't enough excitement in your life and never will be. Believe that you have the power to cure any such downtrodden feeling that you might have at this time. Consider joining a spiritual support group where you can honestly share your feelings.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 16, 2020</strong> - In an effort to be the brightest and best star on the stage, Pisces, you might actually be driving away the most important members of your audience. Make sure that you aren't putting on different masks with different people just so you can appease those you're with. Others can see right through any disguise you try to put on. Trying to deceive others is simply a sign of disrespect.</p>
