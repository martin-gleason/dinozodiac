<p><span class="date">Feb 23, 2020:</span> You could be feeling highly insensitive to the problems of other people right now, which is quite a switch for you. This isn't a comfortable feeling, but don't beat yourself up about it! For too long you've been putting the needs and wishes of other people above your own. This could be a natural reaction. Your mind is trying to find balance. Don't you deserve to be a bit selfish once in a while? You don't have to ignore a friend's call, but you can feel free to let it go to voicemail.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 23, 2020:</span> It's a day when you'll be seeking greater depth when everybody else is just content to skim along the surface of things. No one is right and no one is wrong in their respective desires. But you won't find the scintillating conversations you might be seeking. If you have a strong urge to get philosophical with one of your friends and they're not interested, find another way to satisfy your intellectual hunger. Check out some websites about whatever topic interests you. Take charge of getting what you want.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 23, 2020:</span> Fast action is required today. There's a problem that needs to be fixed, and it needs to be fixed as soon as possible, before it gets too big to attack. Be sure to have whatever tools you need to have on hand. Be ready to use them whenever and wherever they're necessary. You need to concentrate on forward motion in your life, not on backward glances. You have no time to waste deliberating over the best way to improve a less than perfect situation.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 23, 2020:</span> You could use a good, long day of self-nurturing! Why don't you cancel that appointment that isn't all that important, skip out on that meeting you really don't want to go to, or call up that nice but slightly exhausting friend and postpone your lunch date? This day should be yours and yours alone! You have to consciously make the time to be alone if you ever want to give yourself the peace and quiet you need. Don't think you'll enjoy flying solo? Try it for an hour. You'll be surprised.</p>

Right now is a great time for you to put all your plans and preparations into motion, because things you begin today are bound to be very successful. All the right pieces are in place, and the right people are supporting you. They are ready, willing, and eager to get in on the ground floor of your next adventure!</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 23, 2020:</span> Take a risk. Try your hand at something you've never done before. It doesn't have to be as adventurous as skydiving or rock climbing. It can be as simple as baking a cake for the first time or trying a different style of clothing. Switch things up and you might just turn yourself on to a new favorite thing. You're full of surprises, and you can even surprise yourself once in a while. Stretching your knowledge isn't all about academic learning. Life experiences count, too.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 23, 2020:</span> It's not always the best idea to be direct in your communication. Take today, for example. You might get a lot further by being more subtle. The people you're dealing with are touchy folks who enjoy their privacy. They won't take too kindly to blunt questions and forceful conversational styles. Instead, warm them up with some observational humor. Do some people-watching with them. You'll get a great sense of what they're all about and what appeals to them.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 23, 2020:</span> As careful as you may be right now, you don't have to hesitate when it comes to taking risks. Luck is on your side, and things are definitely looking up! The bad vibes are long gone, and they show no signs of popping up again in the near future. If you have some sort of examination or test today, you're sure to do even better than you expect. It's also a great time to take a walk on the wild side. You'll have a fun adventure without putting yourself in any real harm.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 23, 2020:</span> You're pretty smart, and you know it, but you want to get even smarter when it comes to one specific thing. Find an expert you admire and pick their brain about whatever it is that's captivating you right now. If you can't talk to them face-to-face, shoot them an e-mail. Ask them the questions you need answers to, and find out how they've achieved what you want to achieve. The best way to learn is to go to the source. You want to hear it from the horse's mouth.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 23, 2020:</span> Add more structure to your life and you could see some amazing results. Any problem you've been struggling with will fade away once you get yourself more disciplined and better focused. Do you have a set bedtime? If not, pick a time that will always give you at least eight hours of sleep. How are you doing with your savings account? Set up a real budget that requires you to deposit a set amount each month. It doesn't have to be a huge amount. It just has to be something. Letting yourself go isn't wise.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 23, 2020:</span> It's time to let your hospitable nature shine a bit more brightly. Sometimes you get so caught up in your day-to-day life that you forget to take the time to welcome new energy and new people into your life. Every day you encounter someone you've never seen before, whether it's a new checker at the grocery store or the new person you've been assigned to work with! Today, savor this meeting a little bit more and smile a bit wider.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 23, 2020:</span> You should always think before speaking, but today you shouldn't think for too long! There is a fine line between mulling things over and putting things off. If you don't pounce on a hot opportunity today, it will cool off, or worse, someone else will beat you to the punch. It might seem like a good idea to weigh all the pros and cons, but it's not. If your gut tells you to go for it, then go for it. Faster action will get you quicker rewards.</p>
