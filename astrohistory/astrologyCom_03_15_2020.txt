<p><span class="date">Mar 15, 2020:</span> If you're tired by the middle of the day, another cup of coffee is not the answer. Today, start investigating new ways to take better care of your health. From getting more sleep each night to having a better breakfast to going to the gym more often, there are many simple options that will have a big impact on your energy level and attitude. There is no time like the present to start steering your life down a more positive and productive path. It's not hard!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 15, 2020:</span> There is so much more to life than being attractive, so try not to get too caught up in the culture of beauty. You're already a beautiful person inside and out. The people who choose to be in your life can tell you that any time you need them to. The faces you see on magazine covers are airbrushed beyond all recognition, so holding yourself up to those standards is ridiculous! Oh, and you know what's also ridiculous? People who think that looking good is all it takes to be good.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 15, 2020:</span> Like it or not, you simply can't control how other people see you right now, although you might feel like you should at least try. Avoid this futile exercise today. There is no point in trying to convey a particular side of your personality. It's too exhausting, and it's way too silly. You need to show your entire self to the world! Sure, from time to time your thoughts might be misread, but who cares? You can't be held responsible for the way other people's minds work. Be yourself!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 15, 2020:</span> You'll quickly catch all the subtleties of whatever people are saying today. For you, they're like giant neon signs that reveal the true meaning behind what people are verbalizing to you. But for so many other people, these small details will be totally lost. So be patient and be gentle if you have to explain what's really going on to the confused folks around you. As you act as translator to the world around you, your level of importance will grow significantly.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 15, 2020:</span> Coordinating an outing with one of your friends could require a lot of back and forth today. One of you may not be in the mood to get too definite about things and prefer that everything should be left up in the air. But by being impulsive, you could be missing out on some great activities that require advance notice, like tickets to a show or dinner reservations at a popular restaurant. At the very least, try to figure out the when and the where of this upcoming date.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 15, 2020:</span> Intellectually challenging things will make a lot of sense to you today, so it's a good day to address a project or book that has been vexing you. You'll have a great aptitude for understanding complicated ideas around philosophy, politics, and economics. If you're being tested or challenged in any of these areas today, expect things to go very well. The dots are finally getting connected in your mind, and you can see how everything works together.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 15, 2020:</span> Someone who isn't exactly your favorite person could be heavily involved in your life today, and you need to make the best of it. It's too late to try to work around them. First, you have to set aside any grudges you hold against this person. They'll only cloud your mood and make you grouchy. There is too much at stake for you to be consumed with the personal issues you have against them. Give them the respect they deserve, as painful as that might be.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 15, 2020:</span> There is nothing quite like a secret to cause a whole lot of drama. If you don't think that you're up for it all, it would be best to disseminate the information to everyone all at onceâ€”or not at all. You can't have the best of both worlds this time. It's not that you can't trust your people to keep your confidence, it's just that right now you can't put them in the position to have such tantalizing information and not be able to do anything with it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 15, 2020:</span> It might be tempting to move through today quickly, but speed won't help you save time. It will only encourage you to make mistakes. Don't rush today. There are details that need to be covered, and covering them requires that you take some time. Go nice and slow. Doing so will increase your chances of making new mental connections and help you come up with ways of getting things done. Paying attention to small facts and figures will energize you.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 15, 2020:</span> To get ahead on a new opportunity, you might have to do some research today. Whether it's a romantic, business, or educational endeavor that you're starting with, find out about this person's past. Find out what they like talking about and what they don't like talking about. You don't have to change who you are just to please them, but it would be wise to customize the conversation. Getting started on the right foot can help ensure a smooth journey.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 15, 2020:</span> You're usually a big-picture thinker who leaves the details for other people to figure out. But you might be missing out on some intricacies that can give you a more thorough education. Don't be afraid to ask questions and get a better grip on things. Cover all the details now and you'll learn more, and you'll become a more valuable member of the team. Even though you aren't required to get involved in something, it might just be in your best interests to do so.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 15, 2020:</span> Your creativity and energy will combine to make you look like one heck of a problem solver! From dealing with something as minor as a missing button all the way up to something as major as a missed deadline, you can handle everything with aplomb, especially things that send other people into stress fits. Of course, no one needs to know that you're weaving most of this magic out of thin air! You have stellar instincts right now, and they can carry you far.</p>
