<p><span class="date">Mar 24, 2020:</span> The future belongs to people who think for themselves, so where does that leave you? Being a part of the crowd is important, and you certainly don't want to create tension among your people. But when you start agreeing to things that you don't actually believe in, that's too far over the line. Today, hold on to your convictions and keep your individuality. If other people react poorly to your opinions, that's their problem to solve, not yours.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 24, 2020:</span> You need to avoid getting involved in anything that looks remotely like a power struggle today. First, you don't need the drama in your life right now. And second, there is never a real winner in situations like these. Sure, there is someone who comes out on top, but the resentment directed at the victor is too isolating to be ignored. You need to focus on working with people, not against them. It's healthier and much more productive.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 24, 2020:</span> Try to avoid preachy people today, especially the ones you don't agree with! They won't pay attention to a new point of view and will go to great lengths to mock it. This kind of ignorance is not something you ever enjoy, so why put up with it? If it's a powerful person who's spouting all the hot air, just walk away. You don't have to pick a fight with them and get in their bad graces. Just remove yourself from the situation.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 24, 2020:</span> If you can be flexible, you'll have a much better day than if you stick to your guns and close your mind to other ways of doing things. You don't know everything—perhaps that's shocking news, but it's true! Try to have a sense of humor about doing things you don't want to do. Not only will it keep you happier, but being able to adapt will help you rise above all the pettiness that others create and keep you out of any drama.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 24, 2020:</span> If your strategy for making a change in your life is based on hoping and wishing for things to be different, you need to find a different approach! Luckily, a creative friend may have wonderful suggestions about how to make good things come into your life. Their ideas might not sound very earthshaking to you, but if you follow their advice, you could soon see that a small alteration in your daily routine has a ripple effect on the rest of your life.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 24, 2020:</span> Having a routine can help you get things done more quickly, but it can also make things a little bit boring. If you're looking for a way to make your regular way of doing things a little bit different, ask a few friends for advice. Find out how they keep variety in their life, and try to apply one or two of their tactics to your day. It might not feel comfortable at first, but at least it will be different, and that can be very interesting.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 24, 2020:</span> There has been some distance growing between you and a friend, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Don't worry that the relationship is coming to an end. Friendships aren't always just about having fun. They should be about growing, too, which means growing pains are inevitable. You two are good for each other, so focus on that. It's important for you to respect them and accept their opinions even if you don't agree with them. Value the history you share together.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 24, 2020:</span> People might have a tough time agreeing with you about what is the right way to go about doing things, but the reason they're resisting your solutions might have less to do with the quality of the ideas and more to do with their own egos. Their insecurities are leading to conflict right now, so don't take them seriously. If you have faith in your strategy and ideas, you should stand behind them. There comes a time when you have to make a stand.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 24, 2020:</span> If you're currently in a relationship, you should be prepared to roll up your sleeves and get to work. Some issues could pop up that you'll need to deal with. It's nothing that will be all that difficult, but it will be time-consuming. Plus, all the work you put in will bring the two of you closer. If you're not in a relationship, then you can work a little harder to connect to your latest crush. If they're not getting it, you need to be more obvious!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 24, 2020:</span> There could be a big case of the blahs going around today, so don't expect to get a lot done unless you wake everybody out of their stupor! You might have to work extra hard to get everyone to step out of their usual routine and start thinking outside the box, but you'll have fun doing it. And once you get people to see what they could be doing instead of seeing what they always do, they'll be grateful for the wake-up call.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 24, 2020:</span> Someone is going to be inspired by you today. Your recent accomplishments are making them think twice about things, and now they might want to instigate a change or two in their life. Unfortunately, you probably see complications in their plan. Should you rain on their parade or support them blindly? You'll have the answer later, when they come to you for advice. Be honest and warn them of the complications that they could encounter. You need to protect as well as support them.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 24, 2020:</span> It's a fine idea to plan ahead, but make sure you're doing it with facts and not just wishes and hopes. Daydreaming about your future is like playing pretend—it's lots of fun, but it's not very appropriate for grown-ups. Today, stop picturing what your life will be like in a decade and just focus on making it better now. Try to live in the moment. In order to create a better life down the road, you have to improve the foundation today.</p>
