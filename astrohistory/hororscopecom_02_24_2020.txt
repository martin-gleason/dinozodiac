<p><strong>Feb 24, 2020</strong> - Construction on streets or buildings might make it difficult for you to get around your neighborhood today, Aries. Traffic could be backed up for blocks. If you must run errands, either walk or get them done early in the day. The work could foul up the phone lines as well, at least for a while, so you might miss some calls you needed to take. This could be a frustrating day. Keep yourself busy at home.</p>

<p><strong>Feb 24, 2020</strong> - Disappointment in a prominent public figure you've always admired could cause an ethical crisis today, Taurus. You might find yourself doubting beliefs and values that you've accepted without question for most of your life. Bear in mind that this is actually a healthy process. By tomorrow you'll probably have made peace with yourself, and should have done some growing up in the meantime. Hang in there!</p>

<p><strong>Feb 24, 2020</strong> - A lack of contact between you and a romantic partner could have you feeling rather depressed today, Gemini. You might be tempted to jump to the erroneous conclusion that your beloved no longer cares about you and that's why your phone isn't ringing. Don't fall into this trap. If you try to be objective, you'll realize that this isn't true. Chances are that your friend was held up in some way and will call as soon as there's an opportunity.</p>

<h1>Cancer Horoscope</h1>

<p><strong>Feb 24, 2020</strong> - You tend to be very intuitive, Cancer, but today your channel to the other side could appear to be totally blocked. You can't sense what others are feeling, and oracles like the I Ching just don't make sense any more. You may try to fall back on logic, but that doesn't work today either. Don't think this is a permanent situation, however. Your mental biorhythms are low. You should be back to normal in a few days.</p>

<h1>Leo Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=5


<p><strong>Feb 24, 2020</strong> - Youâ€™re usually a hard worker, Leo, whether the work involves a job, personal project, or simply chores around the house. Today, however, you're going through a fit of laziness. Chances are you don't want to do a thing except lie around and read or watch TV. It's OK. We all need time to let our hair down and relax. Don't suffer undue guilt because you don't feel like working.</p>

<h1>Virgo Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=6


<p><strong>Feb 24, 2020</strong> - Today you just might want to cut yourself off from the world and hide, Virgo. Your backyard or bedroom seems especially attractive right now, and you might have just purchased a new paperback that you're dying to read. You won't even feel like sharing a meal with the rest of the household. Don't worry about this. We all want some time alone occasionally. Your family should understand.</p>


7:
<h1>Libra Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=7


<p><strong>Feb 24, 2020</strong> - A friend or relative might propose some travel, Libra, but today you don't even want to think about going to the grocery store. You won't feel much like talking to anyone, either. Your mind is probably on intellectual or metaphysical matters. You could just want to stay home and study those subjects all day. Tell your friend the idea of traveling sounds great and you'll discuss it later. That's all you can manage right now.</p>


8:
<h1>Scorpio Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=8


<p><strong>Feb 24, 2020</strong> - Gloom may settle upon you today when you face your financial situation, Scorpio. You may have had a lot of bills to pay, and thus your coffers could be a bit low for your liking. Still, this is only temporary, and it probably feels good to have the bills out of the way. Find something inexpensive, like reading, to keep you busy and get your mind off it. You're probably doing fine!</p>

<h1>Sagittarius Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=9


<p><strong>Feb 24, 2020</strong> - This morning you might look in the mirror and be horrified at what you see, Sagittarius. You've been working hard and are stressed out, so you probably look tired. You're apt to blow it all out of proportion, however, and think you look a lot worse than you actually do. Treat yourself to some new clothes and a walk, and then get some rest. Tomorrow you'll probably look as terrific as ever. Hang in there.</p>


10:
<h1>Capricorn Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=10


<p><strong>Feb 24, 2020</strong> - Something could happen during the day that unconsciously reminds you of something unpleasant that happened to you in the past, Capricorn. You might not even remember today's event, but memories of the occurrence long ago could plague you throughout the day and put you in a very black mood. Try to analyze why this memory affects you so much. Then when you know, let it go. You might feel as if a heavy weight has been lifted off your shoulders.</p>


11:
<h1>Aquarius Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=11


<p><strong>Feb 24, 2020</strong> - None of your friends may be at home today, Aquarius, and so you probably won't be able to have any phone conversations or visits with them. This could cause you to feel rather lonely. You might brood a little and convince yourself that no one cares about you any more. Snap out of it! You know full well this isn't the case. Read or watch videos until someone rings you up, and they will!</p>


12:
<h1>Pisces Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=12


<p><strong>Feb 24, 2020</strong> - Today you might find yourself compelled to stay at home for some reason, Pisces. Perhaps you're expecting a visitor who's late or a delivery of some kind. Therefore, you could feel somewhat antsy. You like staying home, but only if you choose to do so. Find something creative to fill the time you have to spend waiting. That might make you feel as if you're choosing even if you aren't.</p>
