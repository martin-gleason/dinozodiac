You'll be feeding off the good vibes and sending smiles to everyone whether you like them or not. This goodwill won't feel forced—you'll just be seeing everyone in the best possible light.

<p><span class="date">Apr 5, 2020:</span> Right now your brain is wide open to new ideas and new ways of doing things. Stepping out of your comfort zone has never felt so good, so take a walk on the wild side and remind yourself what it's like to feel a little out of your element! There has never been a better time to explore a new hobby or interest. How about checking out a career opportunity that you've been thinking about pursuing for a while? You're about to enter a very sweet time in your life.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 5, 2020:</span> If you're trying to impress someone, get their attention, and don't be shy about sharing stories from your life, especially if they involve something you have in common with this person. The more details you can offer the better. Their role in your life is surely going to get bigger, so expect to hear from them a lot more in the future.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 5, 2020:</span> If a friend or loved one is in a bind right now, you need to fight the urge to swoop in and save them like a superhero. It's not that you should abandon someone you care about; it's just that this person needs to figure their own way out of this mess. If they got themselves into it, they should get themselves out of it. If they ask for your help, give them logic, not flattery. They need to face reality today so they won't make the same mistake tomorrow.</p>

You're extremely open to new ideas right now, and you're perfectly ready to experience a few new things. If you're shopping for some new clothes, opt for colors and patterns you wouldn't normally go for. If you're cooking dinner, choose a dish you've never made before. And if you're trying to pick out your next vacation spot, skip the standard locales in favor of an unexpected one.</p>

Every step you take is a step you're taking in the right rhythm, and you'll be feeling more soulful than ever once you've taken it. The temptation is out there to pick up the pace, but that's not the right maneuver right now. Just keep doing what you're doing. Things are happening the way they should be, at the right speed, and you need to trust in that.</p>

Even if your calendar is completely blank, your in-box is empty, and no one else is around, you'll be easily entertained all day long.
