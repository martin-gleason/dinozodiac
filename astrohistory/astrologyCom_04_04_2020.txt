<p><span class="date">Apr 4, 2020:</span> Speed could become a problem for you right now. Forces are pushing you to go at a more rapid pace than you might be comfortable with, and it's time to decide once and for all whether you're going to let these forces keep pushing you around. If these folks are in such a hurry, why not just step aside and let them go off on their own? Calling their bluff will quickly prove that they need you more than they thought they did. Then they'll be quite willing to do things your way.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 4, 2020:</span> Just because an argument is over doesn't mean that your lingering feelings of guilt, regret, or anger are gone. You can't expect everything to get right back to being rosy right away. You need time to let things settle inside of you for a while. When you're both ready to resume your regularly scheduled activities, you can. But if you try to push too hard to make things "normal" again, you'll only be creating unrealistic expectations. The love is still there, don't worry.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 4, 2020:</span> Every movement you make should be made carefully today. You must consider the effects of your behavior. This doesn't mean that you should avoid moving forward on anything, it just means that you have to be aware of the consequences of your actions. By being more aware, you'll be better prepared to handle any objections or negative reactions that may pop up from co-workers or siblings. You don't want to make them think you aren't considering them.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 4, 2020:</span> One of your friends is too embarrassed to talk to you about something, but they still crave your advice. Keep an eye out for a struggling pal today. Send a few inquiring messages and find out what's up with them. Your warmth and compassion will be all it takes to get them to come out of their shell. Listening skills will come in handy in all sorts of places today, giving you a wonderful excuse help out where you can.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 4, 2020:</span> Teamwork can bring out the best in you, but one person isn't going to react well to the group dynamic. Don't be surprised if someone acts a bit more critical of your decisions than is necessary. They don't like the fact that they don't have more power than you. That's their problem, not yours. Carry on and ignore their negative energy. As soon as they see that you know what you're doing, they'll hush up and hop on board.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 4, 2020:</span> If you're put in an unfamiliar situation today, all you can do is try your best. Put the idea of whether you'll fail or succeed out of your mind. If you focus too much on the outcome, you'll psych yourself out! Just focus on putting one foot in front of the other, and keep taking those baby steps until you're done with this journey. By focusing on the smaller, less intimidating details, you'll prevent yourself from getting overwhelmed. You can do this!</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 4, 2020:</span> Get a load of you! You're full of good energy, and you shouldn't keep it to yourself! Your smiles and goofy jokes can help lift the mood of sad people, distract worried pals, and remind the folks you love why they love you. Today also brings a great chance to build on the promising nature of a new relationship and get a lot closer with someone you find incredibly interesting. Unleash all your charm and you'll get promising results.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 4, 2020:</span> Today, you could be hit with an idea that you're pretty sure is brilliant, but you're equally sure that the rest of the world is going to think you're nuts! So what? Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Resist the temptation to censor yourself. Your ego is trying to protect you from getting your feelings hurt, but your pride is ready to risk it. When you announce your new idea, do so with confidence. Don't ask for people to like it. Assume that people will like it!</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 4, 2020:</span> Work could be fairly frustrating today. No one is focused on getting stuff done or contributing their fair share. They're essentially all talk and no action. If you're looking for motivation, you're going to have to look in the mirror, because you won't find much in your peer group. The good news is that time is on your side. The deadline you're dealing with is far enough away that one or two days of treading water shouldn't matter too much.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 4, 2020:</span> Today, it could be nearly impossible for you to find someone who is smarter than you. Your intellectual energy is extremely strong, and the good news is that it's not going to go take you overboard. You won't have to worry about intimidating anyone when you come up with the answer everyone's been looking for. There are different kinds of intelligence, which you should keep in mind. While you might be the smartest person today, that might not be the case tomorrow.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 4, 2020:</span> You're looking good today—in every sense of the word. Your mind is firing on all cylinders, and if you're not already on top of all your tasks, you'll get there soon. Physically, your body is experiencing fewer aches and pains. People are pleased to hear from you, and you're getting noticed in new ways now. You should smile right back at all those people who are smiling at you. Are you ready for your close-up?</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 4, 2020:</span> Other people in your life have been keeping you busy, and it's been fun! But have you been falling behind on chores or other household issues? It's time to get back in touch with what you need to take care of in your life. Bills, cluttered closets—these might not be very glamorous things, but they aren't going to take care of themselves. The good news is that they will only take a couple hours, then you'll be free to relax.</p>
