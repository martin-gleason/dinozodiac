<p><span class="date">Apr 12, 2020:</span> Stop furrowing your brow and take a nice, deep breath. Relax. Today's activities will go very well. You don't have to worry about lacking the skills or the charm you need. You are perfect just the way you are. All you have to do now is prove it to others. Put yourself in their shoes, look at things from their perspective, and you'll be fine. And remember that you need to evaluate them, too, just as they're evaluating you.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 12, 2020:</span> Lucky you! It looks as though you're going to have a little extra cash in your pocket very soon, which in turn will put a big smile on your face! Money is always powerful, but right now it can affect your mood and life situation much more profoundly than you think. Be smart about how you spend it, and remember that once it's gone, it's gone. There is nothing wrong with spending it in frivolous ways. Just make sure that you know what you're doing.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 12, 2020:</span> It's important for you to have an action plan today, even if your day isn't full of large mountains to climb. From running little errands to presenting a big, new idea, you need to have a plan if you want to succeed. Prioritization is a great way to make the best use of your day, and it's the best way to avoid wasting valuable resources like money and, most importantly, your precious time.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 12, 2020:</span> Do not give up if things aren't going as smoothly as you'd hoped. Keep pushing forward. This process is taking more time than expected, but that could work to your benefit in the end. Maybe you need to slow down. Sometimes slow and steady really does win the race. If you feel as though you're repeating yourself again and again today, maybe it's time to change the way you're delivering the message.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 12, 2020:</span> Just like peanut butter and jelly or ham and cheese, you and someone else make one heck of a good combination today, so good, in fact, that you might be shocked. The stars warn that this seamless collaboration might be a temporary thing, so just because things go well today doesn't necessarily mean that the two of you should form a permanent alliance or commitment. You will work well together in the future, but you won't be a great team for every situation.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 12, 2020:</span> Retail therapy is not a very effective way of dealing with problems right now, so put the plastic away! Any impulse buys you make today might provide temporary relief for your symptoms, but they definitely won't do anything to cure the underlying cause. Save your money and instead take a walk, call a friend, or do something else that costs nothing. You'll get much more value of out it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 12, 2020:</span> Lately, you've been pleasing a lot of people and making a major impact without even trying that hard, and this type of oversize effect is going to continue for a few more days. It's time to call in a few favors and see who is willing to pitch in on your behalf. You will be happily surprised when you see who raises their hand. Be careful not to be too friendly with new people. You run the risk of making them think that you're flirting with them.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 12, 2020:</span> This isn't the day to be passive about your passions! You have the right to speak your mind about whatever is important to you, no matter how controversial it might be. Who cares if what you say sparks a debate or ruffles a few feathers? After all, you've never been one to shy away from a fight, so why start now? You have the right to disagree with important people, just as you have the right to disagree with your peers.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 12, 2020:</span> There is an amazing amount of warmth coming your way today, and it's all coming from the people you choose to have in your life, the people you feel proud to call your friends. You are indeed loved by your friends, and you'll always be able to count on them for the wise counsel, unwavering support, and positive reinforcement that you need. Today, make time to talk with them and enjoy some of the private jokes and friendly silliness that make your life sweet.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 12, 2020:</span> Just who's in charge of your life right now? Take a look at your calendar, and you might notice a few too many things that you aren't really looking forward to. If you've been pressured into doing something you don't want to do, it's time to start flexing your muscles. Initiate plans of your own, and make sure that the things you do are the things you want to do! You can't be everything to everyone, so fulfill your current commitments and then commit to yourself.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 12, 2020:</span> Learning opportunities could come at you from many different directions today, and it's up to you to take full advantage of each one of them. One great way to open yourself up to learning is to immerse yourself in a different culture—its language, music, art, and cuisine will invigorate you and expose you to new ideas. You have a lot more options than you may think, and you have a lot more to learn than you may realize.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 12, 2020:</span> You're can look forward to a sweet and worry-free time in your life, when having fun and feeling good are all you need to think about. This is a great time to begin exploring a new hobby, interest, or career opportunity that you've been thinking about. "Out with the old and in with the new" should be your mantra right now. Your brain is open wide to new ideas and new ways of doing things. Stepping out of your comfort zone has never felt so good, so take a bit of a walk on the wild side!</p>
