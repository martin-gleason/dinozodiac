<p><strong>Mar 24, 2020</strong> - If you've been thinking about taking a trip, Aries, this isn't the day to make plans. Whatever you learn today about airline schedules or hotels may not reflect the situation as it really is. If you wait a few days, things should go far more smoothly. If you already have plans to leave, expect some delays. Don't let them put you in a gloomy state of mind! Make up your mind to have fun!</p>

<p><strong>Mar 24, 2020</strong> - A letter or phone call regarding money that you may be expecting may still not come today, Taurus. This could put you in a panic and cause you to want to phone those responsible to see what's going on. Don't be surprised if you end up playing phone tag. This just isn't a good day for any sort of communication. Your call will come. Just hang in there for a day or two more.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 24, 2020</strong> - An invitation to a social event could come today, Gemini, and you probably won't want to go. The people involved may not have anything in common with you, and you'll probably feel the event will be tedious and boring. Nonetheless, there may be business factors involved that could have you thinking you should go anyway. How urgent is the business? How important are the contacts? Think about it before you accept or decline.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 24, 2020</strong> - Are you feeling a little under the weather, Cancer? You may have been burning the candle at both ends. The obvious tip would be to slow down, but you might feel it isn't possible now. Get as much rest as you can and be sure to eat right. Ask for help if urgent work needs to be done. That way it will get done quickly even if your energy level isn't up to snuff.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 24, 2020</strong> - A long-anticipated visit from a close friend or love partner may have to be postponed, Leo. This could be rather disheartening. You may fear that the postponement implies that the visit will never happen, but this isn't the case. Your friend has probably run into a few snags that need to be straightened out. Be patient and hang in there. All should work out as you want, albeit a bit later!</p>

<p><strong>Mar 24, 2020</strong> - Career matters may be put on hold today, as important communications you're expecting fail to come on time, Virgo. As you're anxious to conclude the matters involved, you could make yourself crazy with frustration. Don't do this. Find something else to do while you're waiting and the time will pass more quickly. You'll get something done besides. Your primary concern will be resolved, just not when you'd hoped. Be patient!</p>

<p><strong>Mar 24, 2020</strong> - Short trips in your neighborhood may be rendered nearly impossible today by factors above and beyond your control, such as traffic, construction, or both, Libra. If you have errands to run, put them off. If you can, walk or ride a bicycle. If you must go in the car, however, make sure you have your favorite music with you so you can do something while waiting in traffic. Otherwise, you'll go crazy with boredom.</p>

<h1>Scorpio Horoscope</h1>

<p><strong>Mar 24, 2020</strong> - This isn't the day to take care of paperwork, Scorpio, particularly if it involves money. Your mental processes are slower than usual, and you may find that you're easily distracted. Your mood won't be all that great either, so it might be a good idea to wait a few days before tackling tasks like this. If the work is urgent, ask for help. You'll be able to stay more focused if you do.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 24, 2020</strong> - Communication with partners is likely to be poor to nonexistent today, Sagittarius. This isn't the time to enter into contract negotiations or other discussions that could affect your future in a major way. The prevailing mood is down, so whatever you decide today is apt to reflect that mood. It might be best to wait a few days until everyone is in a more positive frame of mind. Hang in there!</p>

<p><strong>Mar 24, 2020</strong> - Whatever work you do today could go more slowly than usual, Capricorn, as you're apt to be a bit distracted. You may be preoccupied with the past, especially with feelings and events you thought you'd long forgotten that affect your mood in various ways. This might be a good day to concentrate on routine tasks that you can do automatically, if possible. That way you'll be as productive as always.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 24, 2020</strong> - Phone calls and emails between you and your friends may get misplaced or otherwise go astray, Aquarius. A little patience is called for when trying to reach anyone at this time, especially if modern technology is involved. If a matter is urgent, it might be best to do the old-fashioned thing and actually go see the person in question. That's the only way to ensure reaching anyone right now.</p>

https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=12


<p><strong>Mar 24, 2020</strong> - Delays and frustrations could plague you throughout the day, Pisces, especially regarding communications. A young visitor you're expecting at your home today could be delayed in some way and might not be able to call and let you know. Don't waste any time worrying. Your friend is probably safe and will eventually turn up. Congested traffic and other unforeseen annoyances are probably to blame. Hang in there.</p>
