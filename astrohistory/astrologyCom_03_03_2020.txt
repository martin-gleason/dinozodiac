<p><span class="date">Mar 3, 2020:</span> When everyone around you is rushing around today, you won't be able to resist the urge to rush around with them, which means that you're going to have a day full of lively activity. Make sure you have a good breakfast—and a good attitude! The morning might start off slowly, but once things get set in place and agendas get finalized, you can expect a lot of energy to be swirling all around you. Jump right into the middle of it even if you're not sure what your role will be.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 3, 2020:</span> If you've been contemplating making a purchase, just keep on contemplating, especially if it's a big-ticket item. Don't rush out and make purchases right now. Whether it's an upcoming blowout sale or an unexpected change in your needs, something is coming in the near future that could make you regret any purchases you make today. Socially, you're starting to compare yourself to someone is who an apple to your orange. Stop trying to follow in someone else's footsteps. Go your own way!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 3, 2020:</span> You could be wrestling with a tricky situation right now, and getting other people's input on the situation is important. You could really use a chance to see things from someone else's perspective. You should definitely check in with the friends you usually rely on, but don't be shy about asking other people what they think, too. Not only will their unexpected answers make you see things differently, but those answers will also help you get to know the people better.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 3, 2020:</span> To get where you want to be faster in your career, you should consider teaming up with someone who balances out your skills. Two heads are better than one, and you both can help each other. Find someone who excels at things you're not terribly good at. This is a good time for collaboration, because any friction you've been having with authority is coming to an end. Doors are easier to open than they've ever been, and your requests will be honored almost without question.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 3, 2020:</span> Learning something new is impossible to do if you already think you know it all, so make sure to maintain your humility right now. Not only will it endear you to people who already know just how savvy you are, it will also help people let down their guard because they're not going to be intimidated. Helping other people feel more comfortable is something that you're awfully good at, and it's something that will enable you to make stronger personal and professional connections today.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 3, 2020:</span> Any problems you're having with co-workers right now might make the workday a little less pleasant, but they're necessary. You've got to iron out your differences, and there's no other way to do it than to talk it out and plow right through it. Be open to a different opinion and hear the other person out, even if it takes everything you've got to keep from interrupting them. The more respectful you are, the more respectful they will be, too.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 3, 2020:</span> An upcoming social event has you torn. On the one hand, you're looking forward to it. On the other, you're worried about how you'll handle seeing a certain person again. Keep in mind that they're probably going through the same conflicting emotions, so this is something you have in common—it's a shared foundation. Put yourself in their shoes and you'll know how to treat them. Things are going to be fine, so just relax and try to enjoy yourself!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 3, 2020:</span> Someone you care about could do something that really irks you today, but you'll have to do your best to avoid getting angry with them. They're a good person and you know it. Don't let your imagination carry you toward irrational thinking about why they did what they did. Things could get ugly if you jump to the wrong conclusions. Start a conversation about what's bothering you, and you'll get to the bottom of things very quickly.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 3, 2020:</span> This is an excellent day to get a lot done and have fun while you do it! Whether you've planned an afternoon of cleaning and organizing, researching a new project, or running errands, you can rest assured that your to-do list will be all but completed by the end of the day. Everything should fall into place—parking spots will open up, traffic lights will turn green, and lines will be short. Time is on your side right now, so make the most of it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 3, 2020:</span> If a new relationship that has been picking up speed suddenly comes to a screeching halt, don't worry! This isn't a sign that things aren't going to work out between the two of you. It's merely a change, and you shouldn't read anything into it. If communication doesn't pick up again in a few days, it would be perfectly reasonable for you to find out what's up. But don't freak out right away. You'll send out desperate vibes, and that isn't who you are.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 3, 2020:</span> Today marks the start of a holding pattern for you. There's no good spot for you to land right now, and it's much wiser for you to stay free and easy (and unattached!) than to tie yourself to some sort of anchor that's less than ideal. Just keep on doing what you're doing, and don't waste too much energy looking for something new. Being picky is still a good way to be right now. It's unwise for you to start any patterns in your life that could be regarded as desperate or careless.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 3, 2020:</span> Your energy is high today, but a little bit of exploration will boost it even higher! Get out there and dive into some new foods, sights, sounds, and neighborhoods. You won't have to go too far out of your local area to find the fascinating experiences and people you're looking for. Simply by taking a new route to work or going to a new lunch spot you'll encounter something that you never saw before. Integrating this new discovery into your life will be fun, easy, and rewarding.</p>
