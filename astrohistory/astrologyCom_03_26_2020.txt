<p><span class="date">Mar 26, 2020:</span> Some important people could pay attention to you today. Are you ready? Whenever the spotlight is aimed right at you, it's important to take your time. Plan your actions ahead. Knowing that eyes are on you might get your nerves twitching, but don't try to rush ahead and show them something just for the sake of showing them something. You've got to impress them with a true display of what you can do. The pressure may be on, but you can excel under it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 26, 2020:</span> You can finally reach a compromise in an ongoing power struggle with a friend if you choose the path of least resistance. So what if you have to give in to what you think are their unreasonable demands? For now, it's the correct strategy to follow. If you keep pushing back, you run the risk of derailing everything, including your relationship! This is more important to them than it is to you, so just give in. You won't regret it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 26, 2020:</span> When you have an intellectual discussion today (and you probably will), try to see things from the other person's perspective. Be more compassionate about where they're coming from and what they've been dealing with. They could be coming from a very emotional perspective and not using logic to their advantage. You're confident enough in your point of view to not have to browbeat or be dogmatic. Go for a softer, gentler communication style today.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 26, 2020:</span> There could be an exciting surprise coming your way, so get ready to have your daily routine knocked on its ear! You've been waiting for an excuse to ditch your plans for a day, and now you've got it. You've learned to be flexible in the face of chaos, and you'll have a great time zigging and zagging throughout the day. People will be impressed, and there's no doubt they'll try to pry your secrets out of you. Tell them it's just a special knack you have.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 26, 2020:</span> In order to build up your ego, you need to stop focusing so much on what other people think about you, especially when the people who you're surrounded by right now don't have any business being critical of others. They're more insecure than you are, so you're only wasting your time by caring about their opinions. Just make the choices and actions that will make you proud of yourself, and don't worry about anyone else. If people want to compete, don't play along.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 26, 2020:</span> Your daily routine could be slightly disrupted by someone who doesn't know the first thing about how to be flexible. They can't bring themselves to see things from any other perspective but their own. Luckily, you have enough flexibility for the both of you, so it won't take any time at all for you to come up with a plan that makes them happy and makes you happy at the same time. Your diplomatic aplomb will be noticed by important people, and it will soon be rewarded, too!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 26, 2020:</span> You have more curiosity than the average cat right now, and if you follow it, you could end up having a very good time! Is there a person you've always wanted to talk to? You could have the chance to pick their brain and find out what's up with them. Is there a sport or hobby you've always found interesting? Learn more about it today. Is there a food you've always wanted to try? Start gathering recipes. Taste more different flavors in life and you'll end up loving life more.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 26, 2020:</span> Travel is on your mind now, so much so that it might be causing some real problems with your family. They want you to stick around in one place a little longer, but you need to stretch your legs! You need to follow your own urges—and figure out a way to communicate that to them. Put yourself in their shoes and have some compassion. That will help you figure out how to have the conversation you need to have with them.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 26, 2020:</span> Like it or not, you have to share the people you love with other people. You don't own your friends, and you can't have a monopoly on all of their free time. If you're getting worried that one of your best friends is focusing too much on someone else, relax. You have nothing to worry about! Keep an open mind about this new relationship of theirs. It could bring some good things to your life in ways you don't understand just yet.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 26, 2020:</span> This isn't a good time to strategize your life based on how much money you want to make. Your career advancement should be structured around what you want to learn, what you want to gain experience doing, and the types of people you want to interact with. Doing something just because it could earn you more money is way too shortsighted. And you don't want to be stuck in a trap later and unable to break free. Focus on what you want to do, not on how much you want to make.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 26, 2020:</span> Odd and unusual things could be very attractive to you today. You're more interested in what sticks out like a sore thumb than in what fits right in, and this mood is especially strong in terms of people. When someone makes waves today, you won't get frustrated or annoyed—you'll be intrigued. Don't miss the opportunity to know this person better. Do what you can in order to get a real idea of how attractive they truly are.</p>

You know, the kind you used to have as a kid that were so engrossing and distracting that you didn't hear it when the teacher called on you? If the answer is anything other than "yesterday," you need to pick a fantasy and go for it! You'll have the downtime to do it. You've got to exercise your creativity and have fun!</p>
