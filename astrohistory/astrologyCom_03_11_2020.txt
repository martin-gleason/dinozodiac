<p><span class="date">Mar 11, 2020:</span> It's a great day for romance, so if you've got a partner, things are going to be sweet! The two of you will have that special unspoken bond, when holding hands is all you need to say. And if you're currently single, guess what? You're going to fall in love with yourself all over again! You'll see how it's so much better to be single and able to spend your time with someone you love (yourself) than to slog along with a partner who fills you with worry or insecurity.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 11, 2020:</span> After a long period of being frustrated that you aren't quite in step with the trends or news of the day, now you're finally entering a phase in which you're the very picture of hipness. All of your interests, fashion choices, musical tastes, and overall style have everyone buzzing with admiration and just a wee bit of jealousy. But don't be pompous about it. Show those folks that it's possible to be with it and charming at the same time!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 11, 2020:</span> If you want to put one of your innovative ideas into action right now, you have to be open to the possibility of asking for help from someone in a higher position than you. This doesn't necessarily mean that you need to ask a teacher or supervisor for assistance; just talk to someone who has a bit more power than you do. Offering them ownership in the outcome is a wonderful way to get them on board, so investigate the pros and cons of starting a new partnership to get things off the ground.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 11, 2020:</span> Be extremely wary of an extravagant gesture from a person who's usually frugal and unassuming. Unless they've recently come into lottery winnings, they might be trying to overcompensate for guilt or some other negative feeling. Get some time with them today to find out what really motivated their generosity. Dig deep until they come up with the real reason. They have assumptions about you that need to be corrected, and you're the only person who can do it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 11, 2020:</span> Your attitude about yourself is going through some changes right now, and it's almost like you're getting to know yourself all over again. This process of getting comfortable with new aspects of your personality isn't always the greatest experience, but it's necessary for improving your confidence. One thing that might help you adjust is to avoid folks who are always telling you what to do with your life. You don't need that kind of advice right now.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 11, 2020:</span> You can be as flexible as a rubber band all day long if you want, but if the people you're dealing with remain rigid, it won't matter how stretchy you are. Unfortunately, the headway you make today depends on other people. The good news is that you can choose who you spend time with. Feel free to refuse invitations from the people who you know are going to want to do things their way. By saying no, you'll be helping them clue in to the fact that they should start being more open-minded.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 11, 2020:</span> Don't be too surprised if others in your work or school life start looking to you for answers today. You have a reputation for knowing what you're doing, and word of your competence is spreading like wildfire. Resist merely giving them the correct answer. You'll only encourage them to stop thinking for themselves. Instead, try to help these people find their own answers. That way, you'll help them more than you ever will by just telling them what they want to hear.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 11, 2020:</span> If you feel like your boss or another authority figure has been trying too hard to control you lately, you're probably right, but that's what they're in your life for right now. Giving up some control over where you go or what you do isn't the end of the world, and it would be in your best interests to stop fighting so hard against them. They know more than you do; otherwise, they wouldn't be in the position they're in. If you want to know as much as they do one day, be quiet and listen now.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 11, 2020:</span> You're in the midst of a growth spurt right now, and you might be feeling the pains that come along with it. To get over the discomfort of this transition, just keep reminding yourself that you are moving away from confusion and toward clearer, simpler ways of thinking. The people you've left behind were distracting you more than you initially realized. All that is over now, and you can look forward to a greater feeling of self-worth and self-confidence.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 11, 2020:</span> Why be shy today when being loud and proud is so much more fun? The people you meet today aren't interested in good manners. They're interested in engaging ideas, and you have a lot of them! Don't sell yourself short or let yourself be overlooked. Stand up and be counted! Your uncharacteristic aggressiveness might surprise a few people who've known you for a while, but it will impress others, specifically, the people who have influence over your life.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 11, 2020:</span> Despite the fact that it can be fun to be part of the crowd, today you need to hold onto your independence! Veer off the road everyone else is on and carve your own trail through the weeds. Sure, it might seem like a nice idea to keep skipping down the road with everybody else, but where the heck are they really going? It's much better to put in the work to go your own way. Stay in control of where your life is headed and you'll always end up in the right place.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 11, 2020:</span> You could be forced to rethink your health when a typical activity leaves you a bit more winded than expected. Frustration will lead you to make declarations of dramatic change. Don't set unrealistic goals for yourself, but do get involved in more physically challenging activities! You need attainable milestones that can boost your confidence and keep you positive about the bigger mountains that you'll need to climb in the future.</p>
