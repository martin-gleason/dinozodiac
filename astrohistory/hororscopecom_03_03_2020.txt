<p><strong>Mar 3, 2020</strong> - Your health has been glowing over the past few weeks, Aries, but today you're likely to feel a little under the weather. This is probably due to nothing more exotic than stress. You've been working hard and concentrating on little else, so your body is now rebelling. You need some rest. Take time off and relax a little, and don't feel guilty about it. Even the President needs alone time occasionally.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 3, 2020</strong> - You might have planned an exciting evening with friends or your current love interest, but you have to postpone it due to forces beyond your control. This could prove both disappointing and frustrating, Taurus, but there won't be much you can do about it. Just reschedule and plan something else for tonight. Distracting yourself might be the best way to go. See a movie or play on your own.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 3, 2020</strong> - Upsetting events in the neighborhood might have family members in a funk. This could be something major like construction crews tearing up the streets, or something as minor as a bout of bad weather. No matter, Gemini, it's going to make your lives a bit more difficult for a while, but you'll have to bear with it. In the meantime, try to cheer everyone up by throwing an impromptu party. This always works!</p>

<p><strong>Mar 3, 2020</strong> - Today you might hear a rather distressing rumor about one or more people you know or perhaps about your working situation. Don't be surprised if more than one person phones or emails to fill you in on this. However, Cancer, this information might not be dependable. It could be based on innuendo or even outright lies. Try to track down the facts before you make yourself crazy over it.</p>

<h1>Leo Horoscope</h1>

<p><strong>Mar 3, 2020</strong> - Personal or professional projects you've been working on might be moving a bit more slowly than you're comfortable with today, Leo. You may wonder if this is because you aren't doing something right. This probably isn't the case. It's no doubt just a normal lag in the energy, which should pick up again tomorrow. Keep at it, get done what you have to, and don't make yourself crazy over it. Go with the flow.</p>

<h1>Virgo Horoscope</h1>

<p><strong>Mar 3, 2020</strong> - Today you might feel stifled by your current situation. Perhaps you're thinking of changing jobs or professions, or maybe you're considering moving to a more exotic place. These all might be good ideas, Virgo, but today isn't the day to make any definite decisions or even consider your options. You aren't in an objective frame of mind. Wait a few days and then think about this some more. You might change your mind.</p>

<h1>Libra Horoscope</h1>

<p><strong>Mar 3, 2020</strong> - Attempts to master a new computer program or other form of high-tech equipment could seem to be going nowhere, Libra. You might tend to doubt your ability and thus feel very frustrated. However, keep at it. You aren't beyond all help! Nothing more than a little focus, concentration, and dogged persistence is required. It might also pay to ask someone's help who knows more about it.</p>

<h1>Scorpio Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=8


<p><strong>Mar 3, 2020</strong> - The rapid level of growth that you've probably been experiencing could suddenly prove too much for you today, Scorpio. You might need to take a little breather to grasp what's happening in your life. New friends, new knowledge, and new opportunities have appeared in profusion, but you could still be feeling a bit down, wondering if you can handle it all. Don't fight these feelings; work through them instead. You'll be better off for it.</p>

<h1>Sagittarius Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=9


<p><strong>Mar 3, 2020</strong> - The energy that has propelled you forward for the past several weeks might seem to lag a bit today, causing you momentary panic that your progress won't continue. As a result, you could be feeling a bit blue. Don't fall into this trap, Sagittarius. The pace has been so fast that it had to slow down sometime. It will pick up again, and you'll have had time to catch your breath. Hang in there!</p>

<h1>Capricorn Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=10


<p><strong>Mar 3, 2020</strong> - Today you might experience a slight (and very temporary) dark night of the soul, Capricorn. You could take a long look at your life and, even though you're doing well, still feel that you aren't yet where you want to be. Spiritually, you might doubt the traditional views you've questioned and still wonder about new concepts you've adopted. Try to distract yourself through reading or perhaps a movie. This feeling will pass by tomorrow.</p>

<h1>Aquarius Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=11


<p><strong>Mar 3, 2020</strong> - A group with which you're affiliated could be excited about a course of action that you might not feel is wise now, Aquarius. You might inform them of your reservations, but they're probably too charged up to listen. You could begin to have doubts about goals of your own that may be taking a long time to manifest. Hang in there. Sometimes things take longer than you'd like, but success is still in the wind.</p>


12:
<h1>Pisces Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=12


<p><strong>Mar 3, 2020</strong> - Plans for getting together with friends or a romantic partner might have to be postponed because of professional responsibilities that need attention. This could prove upsetting, Pisces, especially since you have to disappoint others, but these things happen. Don't let it get to you. This will have no lasting effect on any of your relationships. Work hard, get it done, and schedule time for some fun a bit later.</p>
