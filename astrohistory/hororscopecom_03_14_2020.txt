<p><strong>Mar 14, 2020</strong> - Be careful of gossiping too much with your friends and colleagues, Leo. It's fun to laugh and exchange stories, but remind yourself of the fact that the truth in a story is diminished and changed each time it's repeated. If you gossip too much, your friends may begin wondering what you say about them when they aren't there. Ultimately, this isn't healthy behavior for your friendships. Think about it.</p>
