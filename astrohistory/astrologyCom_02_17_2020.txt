<p><span class="date">Feb 17, 2020:</span> A fierce but friendly conflict with someone could give you a heady rush of adrenaline today. This unexpected energy will go a long way toward helping you get the best of your opponent in a very clever manner. But be gentle, and try not to rub the loser's face in the fact that you're right. Bragging isn't cool. Plus, keep in mind that you won't always be the person who's right! Set an example of how to win an argument graciously. Others will follow it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 17, 2020:</span> You're making some very good progress in what has been (until now) a very tough negotiation, and good for you! This is a time for you to pat yourself on the back and remind yourself that you are a superstar. Your unique charm was the key that unlocked the secret to getting this person to cut you a break. You do know that not everyone else is as capable as you are of turning a tough cookie into a sweet softie, don't you? Be proud of yourself.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 17, 2020:</span> No matter what your current situation is, your life is your own business! Remember that today when busybodies try to bury you in unsolicited and inappropriate advice. They don't know what they're talking about. Just because they have strong opinions about what you're going through (and the choices you should make) doesn't mean that they're right. Stick to your own path, and don't even consider listening to these half-baked ideas.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 17, 2020:</span> Today, the universe may seem to adapt itself to all your moods and desires. This day could be as comfortable as your favorite pair of jeans. If you have any plans, you could find that everything falls into place just as you hoped it would. And if you're not quite sure what you want to make happen today, the day itself will come up with something for you. A trail of coincidences may lead you someplace very interesting.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 17, 2020:</span> Your attitudes about money may be falling out of sync with everyone else's attitudes, and this could cause some minor conflicts. Compromises will be easy to make because all the people you're surrounded by are in flexible and positive moods. It's good that you're feeling thriftier and more conservative than usual, not because you're entering a fiscal crisis or anything like that, but because it's good to remind yourself every once in a while that money doesn't grow on trees.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 17, 2020:</span> Think fast! When was the last really great day you had? If it was more than a month ago, you need to start focusing on how you can create another one as soon as possible. Spend some time today thinking about what is different in your life. Who is in it, and what kind of energy are they requiring you to put out? Is it too much? A few hours of solitude will give you critical insight on how to remove conflict and stress from your life.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 17, 2020:</span> That nagging voice in your head deserves all your attention early today, even if it's telling you things you don't exactly want to hear right now. This problem involves some time-sensitive elements that could create more drama if they're left unchecked, so don't put off dealing with it until tomorrow. You've been battling procrastination for a while, and it's time you decided once and for all to get the job done.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 17, 2020:</span> Today isn't the day to try to push a relationship to a deeper level. You have many secrets at your disposal, but if you use them to connect with someone else, you could be sorry. It isn't a good idea to make yourself look as though you don't know how to keep someone else's confidence, especially when you do. If you want to get closer to someone, you have to be true to who you are. Don't use insider information to make an impression. Just be yourself.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 17, 2020:</span> A difficult conversation you've been dreading could go a lot better than expected. It turns out that other people have been whispering in this person's ear and warning them about the thing you've been wanting to talk about. This person is ready to talk to you and work with you. There's going to be a great deal of positive collaboration overall. Every idea will lead to another, more exciting idea. Keep going!</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 17, 2020:</span> Are you in the middle of working out lots of different details and elements? If so, you're definitely in luck today! It's a great day for putting all your plans and preparations into motion because the stars are aligned in the perfect formation to create optimum results. Your energy is in tiptop shape, and you have a group of supportive people around you who are ready, willing, and eager to participate in your next excellent adventure!</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 17, 2020:</span> Despite what you might think, the people you're dealing with right now definitely know that you're serious about what you're doing. No one thinks you're a pushover. But you still need to keep your guard up and be very careful in business deals. People who tell you that they want what's best for you might not truly have your best interests at heart. Having a healthy skepticism today will keep you and your bank account healthy, too.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 17, 2020:</span> Despite the high level of drama that's creeping into your life right now, nothing too upsetting should develop by the end of the day. No great changes will occur before tomorrow. Right now you're sort of at a crossroads in your life, but the good news is, you don't have to worry about making a commitment or dealing with any major problems. Feel free to put your life on autopilot and ride any wave of good energy that comes your way.</p>
