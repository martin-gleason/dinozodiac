<p><span class="date">Mar 25, 2020:</span> It's the perfect time to organize a group party online, and you won't need an excuse to get your people together. Everyone's in the mood to let loose, laugh, and have a good time. Why not figure out a way to get all your different virtual social circles together? Having all of your worlds collide doesn't have to be stressful. After all, everyone has something in common—they adore you! Get them talking about you and all will be fine.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 25, 2020:</span> A friend's excitement might be a little too outrageous right now, and it's natural for you to doubt it. You're thinking a lot more conservatively, and what they've been going on about doesn't sound so great to your ears. If you mention some of your concerns, they might accuse you of being a party pooper, but you owe it to yourself to call it like you see it, and you owe it to them to alert them to the potential problems you see.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 25, 2020:</span> Old dogs can in fact be taught new tricks, which you could see for yourself today when someone proves to you just how much they've changed! It could be that a penny-pinching friend has finally splurged on a luxury treat. Or a shy co-worker announced that they've just posted a video of them singing online. Whatever it is, it's going to radically change your opinion of this person and inspire you to move outside your own comfort zone a little bit, just to see what happens.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 25, 2020:</span> Making an intellectual connection with someone can often be much more significant than making an emotional connection, although it might not feel that way at first. It's easy to get caught up in someone's world when you have strong chemistry, but once that flash is over, will there be a real foundation to stand on? Today, you've got to concentrate on building a real relationship that's about two people and all their complexities. Attraction is nice, but it doesn't always last long.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 25, 2020:</span> You pride yourself on being in touch with the latest fashions, celebrity gossip, and cool music, but how well versed are you on politics, world events, and literature? It's time to diversify your interests. Go to a business website and learn something new about the markets. Watch a historical documentary instead of your favorite sitcom. Being exposed to more things will not only make you more interesting to talk to, it will help build your confidence, too.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 25, 2020:</span> For a great big dose of inspiration and fun, perform an experiment in your life. Try doing something in a new way and see how it works out. Try a different jogging route, fix your coffee differently, eat a new food, watch a movie in the afternoon, cook an elaborate dinner. Do something akin to throwing a wrench into your daily life, and you're sure to enjoy the ripple effects it will have on the rest of your day or even week!</p>

Whether you whip up a four-course meal or a batch of chocolate chip cookies, time spent in the kitchen creating something yummy is fun. Plus, combining a multitude of different ingredients can subtly remind you how good ideas are born when you look at a lot of different potential influences.

It's the perfect day for you to take a little walk on the wild side and remind yourself how exciting it can be to not quite know what you're doing. Thinking on your feet awakens a whole different kind of energy, and it's the kind of energy that makes you feel alive. You're about to enter a very sweet time in your life.</p>

Listen closely to what these strangers say and you'll impress your family and friends with how well you can remember people's names and details about the stories they've told you. It won't take you long to convert the most antisocial person into one of your biggest fans! The most important part of communication is listening, and you understand that.</p>

And let's face it, it's those last-minute opportunities that are usually full of the most promise! Keep your plans loose and be open to the fact that they could change at any moment. You can adapt.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 25, 2020:</span> You may not be dealing with people who are charming, intelligent, or intriguing today, but these are folks who will listen to you, and that's worth a lot. This is a great crowd to manage, so if you're going to be in a leadership position, you're going to have a great day! You don't have to waste time trying to find a solution that will make every single person happy. All you need to do is find the solution that works for most people.

<p><span class="date">Mar 25, 2020:</span> Just when you think some major plans were set in stone, they go flying back up into the air. You'll have to be open to this change to be able to work past it. Some things are just out of your control, so you need to swallow any frustration and go with it. If you aren't flexible about things, you could regret it later. Be like a willow and bend. It will be worth it!</p>
