<p><span class="date">Mar 23, 2020:</span> Your ambitions haven't all come to fruition, but that doesn't mean that you've failed in any way. There is a time and place for everything, so don't get distracted if that big brass ring has escaped your grasp yet again. This isn't the end of your options, so don't beat yourself up about it. Instead, focus your energy on reaching some other new goal. While you're busy climbing that mountain, forces will be working to give you another opportunity to try this one again.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 23, 2020:</span> You need to be mindful of your role in every conversation you have today. People are going to be saying very important things and you need to catch every detail. Taking notes wouldn't be a bad idea. This is a good time for you to gather information on a project or opportunity you're considering. Your mind is clear and able to sort through a lot of different information and pull out the best, most relevant pieces.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 23, 2020:</span> A foreign accent could be like music to your ears today, evoking exotic locales and reminding you that you need to plan a vacation! Whenever you get a taste of wanderlust, you should act on it! Poke around some travel websites, flip through some travel magazines, and pull out your list of all the places you want to go someday. One place will call out to you. Find out what time of year is the best time to visit and get planning!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 23, 2020:</span> Remember, you don't need to spend a lot of money to have a lot of fun. If you've been turning down social invitations for the sake of a bigger bank account, you may be penalizing yourself for no good reason. Let your people know that you're pinching pennies, and they'll be happy to adjust their proposed plans to be a little bit more modest. Plus, they'll probably appreciate the chance to spend less themselves. The buddy system works well for saving money, too!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 23, 2020:</span> The person you could be spending a lot of time with today might not be patient enough to listen to every word you say, so try not to make this the day you confess anything major or bring up a delicate topic. But just because they aren't fully engaged doesn't mean that you won't have a great time together. It's just not the right day to make a deep connection. Keep the conversation light and fun, and don't expect to reach any major milestones.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 23, 2020:</span> Life isn't always black and white, although some people you could be dealing with today think that way. You can ask another person to be open-minded, but you can't force them to be. If you get frustrated by a narrow-minded person, don't try to change them. They've chosen to have this attitude about things, and you'll only come off as preachy if you try to change their mind. Don't worry about ignorant people. They don't know what they're missing.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 23, 2020:</span> If you really want to make a connection with someone in a professional or romantic capacity, you will need to deepen the dialogue you're having with them. Small talk makes for shallow connections, and what you want right now is depth. Ask them about their childhood memories. Find out about their scariest moment. Ask them what they want for their future. Switch topics toward philosophies and fears and you'll make some significant headway.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 23, 2020:</span> Today, your focus could be on your own problems and whatever is going on at home with an older relative. If they need any attention from you, you should do whatever it takes to give it to them. Cancel a date, postpone a trip, or make a long-distance phone call. They miss the sound of your voice and could benefit from a conversation—they won't ask for much more than that. Your unique personality is special to them. After all, they helped inspire it, didn't they?</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 23, 2020:</span> You could encounter someone today whose mind is so closed that you wonder if any sunshine ever gets in there. Their narrow-minded attitudes are going to hinder your progress, even if they have nothing to do with your workload. There's just something about ignorance that gets under your skin, and it's going to be next to impossible for you not to try to get them to open their mind a little bit. It's going to distract you all day unless you say something to them.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 23, 2020:</span> Watch out for impulse buying now. You might think you can't live one more minute without a certain item, but you're wrong, and if you think about it for a few minutes, you'll realize that for yourself. Spending a big chunk of money right now could be a big mistake, so try to avoid putting yourself in any situation where you have the urge to buy. Skip out of any planned social shopping trips, or suggest some other activity instead.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 23, 2020:</span> It's all in your head today. In other words, you can alter your reality by simply thinking differently. Feeling unattractive? Simply remind yourself that you are indeed very attractive, and people will start seeing it. Worried you won't pass a test? Tell yourself that you'll do as well as you can. It's important to realize that your powers of positive thinking are just as strong as your powers of negative thinking, so try to switch your thinking around.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 23, 2020:</span> Try to be more open to change in your life today. If you are, you could enjoy a wonderful last-minute adventure! If you get too stuck on following your schedule to the letter, you'll miss out on some fun, spontaneous stuff. Good for you for wanting to cross things off your list, but is there any harm in putting a few things off for the sake of a spontaneous picnic, dinner with an unexpected visitor, or an exciting business opportunity? Let yourself have a good time if you can—you deserve it!</p>
