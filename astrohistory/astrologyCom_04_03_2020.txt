<p><span class="date">Apr 3, 2020:</span> There could be a lot of confusion around communication today, so do what you can to be clear. E-mails and DMs are more about convenience than they are about truly connecting with another person. If you're nurturing a romance online, the electronic back and forth could be especially frustrating if you're not moving things forward on solid footing. You need to get someone's attention to finish a conversation that started a few days ago.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 3, 2020:</span> Time plays funny tricks on the mind, especially right about now, when you feel like you're under the gun when it comes to making a choice. But if you step out of the stadium for a few minutes, you'll quickly see that there is no rush right now at all. Of course, you can choose to continue at this busy clip, but if you do, you could end up being very indecisive about where to go next. It's much wiser to take a break until it's obvious what your goals are.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 3, 2020:</span> It could become clear today that one of your friends is simply telling you what you want to hear, and they aren't interested in creating any real connection. This might be a temporary issue, or it might be a choice they're making. Either way, you need to find out what's going on in order to figure out if you still want (or need) them in your life. Cut to the chase and find out why they're being so distant. The answer, whatever it is, will set you both free.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 3, 2020:</span> If you feel like you're being held back in some way, don't put external forces at the top of your list of possible causes. No one is affecting your life as much as you might think, so don't attribute to others a power they don't have. Regarding work, the authority figures in your daily routine have nothing to do with this stuck-in-the-mud feeling you have. And if a relationship seems stalled before it even gets out of the starting gates, admit to yourself that it probably wasn't meant to be.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 3, 2020:</span> The indecisive nature of the powerful people around you could be out in full force today, and it could be difficult for you to get the green light on anything. These authority figures are lost in their own thoughts and won't be able to give you too much focus or energy. If you're feeling daring, this is the perfect opportunity to go outside the normal chain of command to get things done. Instead of asking for permission now, be prepared to ask for forgiveness later.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 3, 2020:</span> Convince your people that quality takes time. Some folks are getting antsy, and it's up to you to keep everyone on the same path. Oddly enough, even your quick reasoning won't result in a quick solution right now, so see what ideas everyone else has. This is your chance to lead the group toward solid improvement and build your reputation as someone who really knows how to rally the troops. Gathering input from others is the first step toward being a good leader.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 3, 2020:</span> Due to your special brand of know-how, you're a big part of an exciting development in a friend's love life. Unfortunately, you can't share the great news with the rest of the world just yet. This is one super secret that you simply can't spill—or else! Once it's over, you can talk, but until then, keep yourself distracted with new travel ideas or chores around the house. If necessary, avoid contact with the person who's most capable of squeezing (or charming) this wonderful information out of you.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 3, 2020:</span> Today, gentle teasing could feel like a harsh rebuke and a brief smile could seem like a massive come-on, all because you're going through a very sensitive phase. Physical and emotional stimulation could be magnified greatly, so try to keep to yourself if you can. If you can stay home alone, do it. But if a solo day isn't in the cards, just try to take things slowly and speak up when you're uncomfortable.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 3, 2020:</span> During a chilly conversation today, you could easily let your natural warmth melt someone's frosty tone and leave them smiling. All you have to do is throw them a cute little curveball. Change the subject to something you know they love, and they'll soften up right in front of your eyes. You have quite a way with people right now, and you can convince someone that things are not as bad as they think they are. Spread your sunshine all around. Don't be shy!</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 3, 2020:</span> Let people who want to connect with you connect with you! If you're feeling intimidated, stop. They're attracted to the real you, and they don't have huge, unreasonable expectations. They just want to get to know you better. If you don't think that you're as interested in them as they are in you, give them a chance anyway. Get to know them more so you can either confirm that you do really like them or decide to get to know a cool new person. Move forward with this.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 3, 2020:</span> The friendly competition between you and another intellectual is verging on taking on a battle-like dynamic. To prevent things from getting personal, you need to put a stop to this trend. Make sure to keep your arguments logical and based in fact. Leave out irrelevant topics, and don't push emotionally sensitive buttons. You wouldn't want to win an argument by resorting to such low blows anyway. Leave the tricks and cheating to folks who don't have anything better to say.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 3, 2020:</span> Whatever problems you're having with a family member or friend, rest assured that they're nowhere near as pressing as you think they are. You can step back from the middle of this situation because it's nowhere near crisis level. You're extremely sensitive right now, and your sensitivity could be veering into paranoia. Your anxiety only indicates how important this situation is to salvage, not how unsolvable it is.</p>
