<p><strong>Mar 30, 2020</strong> - A financial goal you've been hoping to reach very soon might seem right around the corner, Aries, but there still seem to be a thousand things you have to do before it's actually realized. This could get you down temporarily, but don't get stuck there. Make a list of whatever needs to be done and then tackle each task one at a time until the goal is reached. Get busy!</p>

<p><strong>Mar 30, 2020</strong> - Expect a hectic pace today, Taurus. Some of your colleagues may have been procrastinating a little and now everything has to be done at once. Don't get too frustrated, however. There are unspoken reasons for their behavior that they haven't shared with you. Just do the best you can and hope that others will as well. If some of it has to wait, it won't be the end of the world!</p>

<p><strong>Mar 30, 2020</strong> - Have you been planning to travel, perhaps for business, Gemini? You might receive word that your trip has to be postponed, which could be disappointing. However, bear in mind that this is only a delay, not a denial. All signs are that you'll make that trip, so don't panic. Think of it as more time in which to prepare. You'll want to be thoroughly ready before you go. Enjoy your day.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 30, 2020</strong> - A proposed get-together with a love interest might have to be postponed until much later tonight or perhaps another evening, %. This could make you a little blue. Your insecurity might even get the better of you. Does your friend not want to meet? Don't fall into this kind of thinking. Accept that there's a reason and go with the flow. You'll enjoy the date that much more for the delay.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 30, 2020</strong> - Are you expecting a close friend or love partner to visit you at home, Leo? Don't panic if your friend doesn't show up at the allotted time. It doesn't mean that no one is coming! There probably has been a traffic jam, last-minute phone call, long line at the supermarket, or some other mundane delay. Be patient and your friend will show up eventually. Hang in there!</p>

<h1>Virgo Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=6


<p><strong>Mar 30, 2020</strong> - An emotional phone call could come from a close friend or love partner, Virgo. This person has a lot of worries, and is apt to lay them all on you if you let it happen. You won't want to drop everything that you'd planned to work on today. Tell your friend that you should get together for dinner or coffee and you'll talk about it, and then finish your tasks as quickly as possible.</p>

<h1>Libra Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=7


<p><strong>Mar 30, 2020</strong> - Financial worries could plague you today, Libra. This is unfortunate, because your concerns are probably misplaced. There may be a few adjustments to make, but nothing a little belt-tightening for a few days can't fix. Find something inexpensive but fascinating to do like reading or watching a documentary. You'll forget your troubles and learn something in the meantime. Once you get past it, you should see it in proper perspective. Relax!</p>

<h1>Scorpio Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=8


<p><strong>Mar 30, 2020</strong> - Love matters could have you feeling uptight and somewhat fearful today, Scorpio. Perhaps this involves a relationship that hasn't really manifested yet, or maybe you and your beloved have had a dispute of some kind. Don't worry too much. You should hear some reassuring words before too long. Try to stay calm when talking to your partner. Sounding desperate or scared could push him or her in the opposite direction.</p>


9:
<h1>Sagittarius Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=9


<p><strong>Mar 30, 2020</strong> - Idealized romantic feelings could pour out today when talking to your love interest, Sagittarius. That's fine, but you should exercise restraint. If it's a new relationship, your partner could be scared off. If it's a long-term involvement, your friend might feel at a disadvantage. Channel the feelings into a poem, song, or painting. If you must voice them directly to your friend, keep the terms general. Don't put your beloved on the spot.</p>

<h1>Capricorn Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=10


<p><strong>Mar 30, 2020</strong> - Money worries could cause you to resist attending a group event with some friends, Capricorn. Are you afraid you'll be tempted to spend more than you can afford now? You probably will, but that's no reason to stay away. Leave your checkbook and credit cards at home. Take only a minimal amount of cash. If you see something you can't live without, take the name and number of the vendor for later.</p>

<h1>Aquarius Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=11


<p><strong>Mar 30, 2020</strong> - Someone you know from work could suddenly seem to have romantic feelings for you, Aquarius. At first this might make you a little uncomfortable, since you've never thought of this person in that way before. Don't do anything rash. Think about it first. Maybe there's potential, maybe not, but don't jump at it or dismiss it out of hand. Who knows? This person could prove to be your ideal mate!</p>

<h1>Pisces Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=12


<p><strong>Mar 30, 2020</strong> - Is your love interest out of town, Pisces? If so, you might spend much of the day feeling lonely and gloomy. Your friend misses you, too, so don't think you'll be alone for long. Try to fill the hours until your partner returns with activities that you love, such as reading or artistic pursuits. The time should then go quickly and you'll be back together before you know it. Hang in there!</p>
