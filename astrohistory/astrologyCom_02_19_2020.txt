<p><span class="date">Feb 19, 2020:</span> You're stuck with a classic dilemma. You want to do one thing, and the person you're with wants to do something else. If this conflict is happening in a business context, it's best for you to just let hierarchy determine what happens next. But if this conflict is in a personal relationship, you need to try to delay your own preferences right now. Bend to their wishes, and your concession will go a very long way toward proving to them that you value time with them more than you value the activity itself.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 19, 2020:</span> It's a good day to spend on yourself. Remember that when you're invited somewhere. There's nothing wrong with setting aside time to fulfill your own interests today. It's not selfish; it's healthy! Set yourself free from all outside pressures and expectations. Reschedule an appointment, take a rain check on that date, postpone that nonessential errand. You shouldn't feel bad about putting yourself first. It's all part of staying healthy and being a better friend or partner.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 19, 2020:</span> You're usually a great source of fun for your people, and today that's especially true! The stars have sent you some positive, relaxed energy that is enabling you to not take things too seriously. Any bad news that arrives today won't sting too badly because you realize how many wonderful things you have in your life. This is a good day to take a big emotional risk, because even if you're rejected, you'll be able to see things in the right perspective.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 19, 2020:</span> It will be extremely easy for you to compartmentalize your life today, which will help you deal with the many issues at hand. When you're at home, you'll be totally focused on the issues around your home, and you won't let any drama at work or school hinder your progress. Harmony isn't always possible, so when it feels futile to try to integrate all the different elements of your life, just don't do it. Keep things separate.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 19, 2020:</span> Memories of an awkward moment in a friendship still hang in the air. Don't you think it's time for one of you to reach out and make an effort to reconnect? Make the first move today. You'll feel good, and you'll gain extra credit for doing so. It may take a while to get the face-to-face time you need with that special someone, but keep trying. They aren't blowing you off! Persistence will pay off in a big way. You'll have them all to yourself for a long, cozy time.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 19, 2020:</span> There could be some minor setbacks in store for you, but nothing too serious. If you're mentally prepared for them, you'll be able to swat them away as if they're annoying little flies buzzing around your head. Embrace the strength that's deep within you. It is significant, and it's ready to carry you over any obstacles. Thinking positively, focusing on the bright side of things, and hunting for the silver lining are all things you should get in the habit of doing.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 19, 2020:</span> It's going to be a super day for you, so get ready to smile and enjoy yourself. You deserve some easygoing energy, and the universe is sending a whole lot of it your way! You'll be getting some extremely positive attention from others, and some of it could have a decidedly romantic angle. Are you ready to move into a new relationship? Think about that question today. The answer might not come easily, which is a good sign. Your heart is something you shouldn't give away carelessly.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 19, 2020:</span> Your forward momentum has never been stronger, so this should be a very easy day for you. Right from the moment you wake up, you'll have a clear idea of where you want to go with your day. Naturally, you'll be so focused on what you're doing that you'll have little (if any) patience for anyone or anything that gets in your way. Have fun blazing your trail, and be generous to all your followers. And don't forget to make time for fun.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 19, 2020:</span> This is a great day for dreaming big, but you have to make a point of figuring out what it is that you really want. Don't forget to let the world know what your hopes and wishes are. How else will anyone know about them? Say them aloud to the universe, and picture yourself enjoying them in the future. The more you keep what you want in the front of your mind, the better your chances of getting it. Promote your ideas and think positive.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 19, 2020:</span> Listening to a wide array of divergent opinions won't be confusing today. It will be invigorating, especially if each of those opinions comes from someone of a different culture. You'll see for the first time how a situation of great conflict can actually serve as an incubator for innovation and new relationships. Just because people disagree doesn't mean that they can never understand each other. Do your part to encourage people to speak their personal truths, and do so yourself.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 19, 2020:</span> Some people think that being an intellectual is the same as being a snob, but you aren't one of those. Your mind is hungry for input, and it's seeking stuff that it has never even considered before. This is an excellent day for crazy input, even if it's confusing. If you spend part of your day solving puzzles, watching a foreign film (without reading the subtitles), or even just listening to music from another culture, your mind will stay pleasantly buzzed.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 19, 2020:</span> Negotiations could be tricky for you today. It's going to be difficult for you to see things from any other person's point of view. This could create some problems in a partnership that you've been developing for a while now, although the problems will eventually solve themselves or turn out to be trivial. You're in the midst of regaining balance in your life, so it's only natural that you won't be able to stay objective all day long.</p>
