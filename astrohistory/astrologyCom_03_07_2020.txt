<p><span class="date">Mar 7, 2020:</span> Today is going to be all about speed! Whether you're ready or not, things are going to move quickly in one of your newer relationships, and you should hang on and see where it goes. Your expectations were so specific that they might not all get met in exactly the way you want, but the overall result should make you very happy. A celebration is coming in the near future that will require you to put on your finest outfit and look your best.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 7, 2020:</span> An old friend has been behaving in some new ways and you're confused. Their recent actions have felt out of character, but maybe they've changed. How well do you really know them anymore? You two need to reconnect as soon as your schedules allow. Go for something intimate. Cook up one of their favorite meals and invite them over for dinner. Find out what is new with them and let them know you've noticed they've changed. Show this person you care.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 7, 2020:</span> You could feel strong flirtatious energy with a surprising someone today, although nothing says that you have to take things to the next level. In fact, the stars favor flirtation more than relationships right now, so it's wise to keep things light and breezy instead of committed and long term. This is a wonderful day for a first date or a social event where you'll have the opportunity to connect with people in your dating demographic.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 7, 2020:</span> You won't be easily guided today. No voices of authority will be loud enough to crack through your brain and change your mind. You know what you want, and no one can stop you from getting it! Although this high level of determination is going to take you places, it's not going to make you any new friends, unless those friends share your same vision. Popularity is nowhere near as important as progress for you right now. Be willing to leave people behind.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 7, 2020:</span> Ready or not, you're entering an indecisive phase, and picking the next project, romantic partner, or job opportunity is going to be a bit rough. There are so many good points to all of your options! But being confused isn't necessarily a bad thing. You should see it as an opportunity to learn how to appreciate all the options that are on the table. Enjoy the luxury of being able to process many ideas before committing to one single solution.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 7, 2020:</span> With your cheerful energy and quick reasoning, you can turn the most apathetic group of people into an enthusiastic crowd of motivated and positive folks today! You know that despite the tough challenges your group is facing, there is always light at the end of the tunnel. All you have to do is make sure that everyone else understands that, too.

<p><span class="date">Mar 7, 2020:</span> Your creativity is good for more than just writing cute little notes inside birthday cards, and today is a great day to explore its full potential. First, get some inspiration outside. Go for a walk to get your blood pumping and your mind working in new directions. Then think about what interests you and intrigues you. Before the end of the day, you'll have a new project in your sights. Getting started on something new is going to get you excited.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 7, 2020:</span> A friend or close family member may be experiencing a significant change in their income, and it's starting to show in their lifestyle choices. You're happy for them, but you can expect some jealousy to creep into your attitude when they tell you about their latest purchase. Focusing on other people's money is only going to cause you to focus on how you compare. Instead, focus on being grateful for what you have in terms of job satisfaction, health, and happiness.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 7, 2020:</span> You were confident everyone would love your idea for a group outing, so how come no one seems as excited as you are? If your social invitation isn't being greeted with all the enthusiasm you'd hoped for, just wait it out. Your friends have an awful lot going on in their lives right now. Their time isn't quite their own, and they just aren't ready to commit. You can't take this personally. Instead, ask them for an idea of a date that would fit into their lives better.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 7, 2020:</span> Casual conversations don't have to be vapid conversations. That would just be a waste of your time. Make sure any small talk you have today is very brief! Don't just yak about the weather or the latest sports scores. Cut to the chase about what is really on your mind right now. Not only will it interest the person you're talking to a lot more, but it will also help you get a better handle on what has been bugging you. You have a lot to say, so why not say it already?</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 7, 2020:</span> Just because you have to do some work today doesn't mean that you can't have a ball while you're doing it! Let your creativity drive your day, and it will help you arrive at some amusing combinations, unusual arrangements, and interesting thoughts that can help the day go faster and be way more fun. Simple things that you do a little differently, from eating lunch at a new place to wearing a pair of wild shoes, can help you have a more intriguing day.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 7, 2020:</span> You don't always need to fully understand every single detail of an idea before you can get involved with it, especially now, when any risk taking on your part is highly favored. Besides, trying to sort through all the details could confuse and overwhelm you and give you too many reasons to chicken out. Gather up all your spontaneous impulses and take that leap of faith! Not only will you land on your feet, but you're sure to burnish your already esteemed reputation.</p>
