<p><span class="date">Feb 25, 2020:</span> Some criticism could be coming your way today, but don't worry. Your ego can handle it. In fact, your drive for success sort of demands this type of honest feedback from others, so it's good to build a reputation of being open to it. Thank the people who are giving you constructive criticism, and ignore the people who are just trying to cut you down to make themselves feel better. The difference will be obvious, so you won't have to worry about who you should listen to.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 25, 2020:</span> The power issues in a relationship are starting to get to you. It looks like maybe you could use a break from one of the partnerships you're trying so hard to keep in balance. The other person is just not willing to work with you on this thing, and they lack a deep understanding of what you really need, despite the fact that you have tried to tell them about it time and time again. It's not the end of things, but it's a sign that you both need your space for a while.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 25, 2020:</span> They say that breaking up is hard to do, but today you'll discover just how hard getting back together can be! The negotiations aren't going very well right now, but by the end of the day the two of you can reach an agreement that leaves you both satisfied. On the other hand, things are getting much easier in your career! The answers you need are all coming to you. It looks like you can finally move forward with that exciting project.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 25, 2020:</span> One especially touchy person could come into your orbit. Their ego is awfully fragile right now, and they're sort of itching for a fight. They've got no particular beef with you, but that won't matter if you say something that inadvertently pushes their emotional buttons. You'll want to play it safe. Don't act out too dramatically, and try not to go to extremes to make your point or get a reaction out of anyone. Be mild mannered and polite.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 25, 2020:</span> Do you want a relationship to move to a deeper, more committed level? The other person might be close to being ready for that, but you have to treat the situation gingerly! Don't push them or try to convince them of what they want. They have to come to the decision all by themselves. If you want to get closer to someone, you have to be true to who you are. Don't use top-secret information to make an impression on them. Just be yourself.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 25, 2020:</span> Don't judge other people today, no matter how confusing and offensive their behavior seems to be. They just march to the beat of a different drummer, and as long as they're not hurting you, they can't be all bad, can they? Take a "live and let live" attitude toward things. Right now, you should just try to have fun with the people who annoy you in life. If you can find a way to laugh at what you don't agree with, you'll have a lot less stress in your life.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 25, 2020:</span> You could be given a very captivating challenge today, and it could push you past what you thought were your limits. Stretching this way will feel a little bit weird at first, but as the day goes on you'll slowly start to enjoy the feeling of going where you've never been before, both literally and figuratively. By the end of today, you might not be totally done with this challenge, but you'll feel a great sense of accomplishment anyway.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 25, 2020:</span> Before you initiate any type of conversation today, take time to formulate your goals clearly. Put together a plan detailing what you really want and another mapping out how you're going to get it. Usually you're the one who adjusts to fit someone else's demands, but right now you need to ask someone else to bend to your schedule. To make it easy for them to say yes, let them know what's in it for them. Or figure out what you're willing to sacrifice in exchange for their cooperation.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 25, 2020:</span> This isn't a very good time for you to be squandering your precious resources. Your time and money are tight, and you'll need to watch out for any unexpected bills! Be careful of getting involved in any new schemes or opportunities that sound too good to be true. Hold off on signing any documents that could commit you to paying a certain amount of money on a regular basis. Watch out for people who want you to make a greater commitment than you can give.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 25, 2020:</span> You might be tempted to smooth out the edges of your personality and play it nice and safe today, but why give in to this temptation? If you put too much emphasis on not being offensive, irritating, or confusing, how are you going to challenge anyone? Stick to your true ideas, and don't worry if some people just don't get it. They're not supposed to anyway. You've got a targeted audience, so speak to that group and only that group. You can't be popular with everyone, so why waste your time trying?</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 25, 2020:</span> Good stuff could happen to you today or quite soon, although it might be a bit difficult for you to accept it! Your curiosity can sometimes get in the way of appreciating the goodness in your life. You want to know why things are happening and how. But in order to enjoy the upcoming good times, you're going to have to let go of this need to know when it comes to why all these things are happening. Get used to the unknown. Try to just be grateful for it!</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 25, 2020:</span> A game of follow the leader is in the works today, but you shouldn't be too interested in playing it. Going along with someone else's plans and doing what someone else tells you to do is not your idea of fun right now. Instead, you should strike out on your own. Even if that just means skipping out on a group lunch or refusing to send around the latest funny video, you should remind yourself that you aren't a sheep. You are unique, and reinforcing that truth today will ignite your sense of purpose.</p>
