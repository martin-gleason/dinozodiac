<p><span class="date">Feb 26, 2020:</span> There are so many different types of communication to choose from, so why not choose one that's a little bit out of the ordinary today? It will get you noticed by people with good taste and vision. Let your creativity go wild and don't be afraid to surprise anyone. After all, who doesn't like a surprise? Even if you just send an e-mail to check in on a friend to see how their day is going, why not make it a poem? And you can sing into a phone just as easily as speak into it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 26, 2020:</span> All your preparation is done. The pieces are put together and now you just have to let it go and see how it runs. Response may be slow in coming, so don't freak out if there isn't a thunderous round of applause right away. While you wait, distract yourself with fun adventures with friends. Do some mindless activities and soak up the latest news about what other people are doing. Step outside of yourself and then check back on results later.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 26, 2020:</span> Just because you have one deep and meaningful conversation with someone doesn't mean that a romance is in the works. You know this, of course, but the other person doesn't. If they heap some unwanted attention on you today, try to change the subject. Make it clear that you are not available, either because you're already taken or you're just not interested. The truth is the best solution even if it seems like leading them on will feed your ego.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 26, 2020:</span> You're quite right to stand up for what you believe in, but today you should try to understand that not every one of your opinions requires such a rigid posture. In fact, you might find that being just a little more flexible with how you perceive the world is going to be lot more pleasant than demanding that everything fit into your carefully planned organizational chart. Some things simply can't be categorized, nor should they.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 26, 2020:</span> If you've done something worth noting, you need to let the people in your life know about it! There's no sense in hiding your light under a bushel. Showing off isn't a crime (although it may make other people feel criminally jealous). You can't worry about coming off as having a big ego right now. Show your pride. Let people think what they want to think. It's not going to affect your mood. Be proud of what you have done.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 26, 2020:</span> Today, you'll see some big, bright signs that prove to you that you're on to something. Follow your instincts and head in the direction that feels right. There is a role you're starting to get comfortable in that you never thought would fit. It just goes to show that life always has surprises that keep you on your toes. Community involvement could give you a bigger sense of purpose, so consider moving into a volunteer situation.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 26, 2020:</span> If you're shopping today, try to stop off at a flea market, vintage clothing shop, or antiques store. There's an undiscovered gem waiting to be found, and you're in just the right place to discover it today. You have an exceptional ability to understand the true value of something that no one else appreciates. Turn away from the flashy and the new. Instead, look for something weathered and old. Find a treasure that has a story to tell and integrate it into your life.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 26, 2020:</span> Business and romantic networking happens all the time, and you have someone in your mental file cabinet who may have an opportunity for you right now. Be proactive, as the experts say, and push forward to build this casual contact into a real connection. Building this relationship could pay off in a very big way. It might send your life in a new direction. Show them you have what it takes, but try not to come on too strong. Lead with your personality and just be yourself.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 26, 2020:</span> As friendships go, your newest one is shaping up to be a significant element in your life. This is something you need to integrate consciously into your life, so think about how making a bigger time commitment will affect things. Spending more time together would be a great way to test how the two of you connect. Plan a weekend getaway or camping trip to get out of the normal environment and see how you two can relate to each other in a new situation.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 26, 2020:</span> Dreams are just silly, surreal plays that your subconscious performs at night, not prescient enactments of what dangers your future holds. If disturbing images have been keeping you from having a good night's rest lately, try not let it worry you. If you do, it will just cause you more stress, and you could have a self-fulfilling prophecy on your hands. You may be powerless to influence the nature of your dreams, but you're not powerless to influence the nature of your life.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 26, 2020:</span> The unusual could be very attractive to you today. You're probing below the surface of things, and your mind will be awakened by what you find. People are very different on the inside than what their outside appearance may lead you to believe. It's not only about not judging a book by its cover today. You might need to read a few pages before you get a good idea of how breathtakingly attractive someone truly is. Don't miss the opportunity to get to know this person better.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 26, 2020:</span> Your charm is legendary, but it might not be enough to light up the eyes of a certain introverted person today. Don't let it get to you! Focus on the people who already know and appreciate you, and don't neglect them in order to win over a new person on the scene. It takes time for some people to come out of their shell and join the group activities, so don't try to force things. If you can give them the space and time they need to get comfortable, you'll win them over.</p>
