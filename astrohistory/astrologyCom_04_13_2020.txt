<p><span class="date">Apr 13, 2020:</span> This is a very good time for you to start a new project. Your energy is solid, and you can count on your brainpower to stay strong throughout the day. There will be no drowsy afternoon vibe for you! Anything involving physical movement is highly favored, so if you're beginning a new workout or starting a new yoga practice, you are sure to have a very successful experience. The only tricky part will be knowing when to stop for the day.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 13, 2020:</span> The added responsibilities you've been given lately are a sure sign that you're making a strong, positive impression on some powerful people. You're ready to take on the next challenge in your life, especially if it involves travel or new cultural experiences. All you need to do right now is stick with your routine and channel any nervousness into positive energy. You simply must start believing in yourself more. After all, if you don't, who will?</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 13, 2020:</span> Do you know your limits? It's time to find out what they are, especially in terms of your social relationships. If you've ever been accused of oversharing, try to hold back on a few of your inner thoughts today. It's not that no one cares; it's just that no one cares as much as you think they do. Wait for people to ask you what's going on in your head instead of spilling it all at the very first opportunity you get. A little mystery couldn't hurt, you know.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 13, 2020:</span> You're all rip-rarin' to go with a new project or endeavor, but not everyone in your crew is feeling as spontaneous as you, so you should expect some reluctance from people today. They might not voice it in the most diplomatic way, so be prepared. Resist the urge to go off on your own and do things without proper backup. You should be careful starting new projects in general right now. Your resources aren't dependable, and people aren't sold on any new ideas.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 13, 2020:</span> A newish friendship could hit a snag when a misunderstanding creates some confusion and hurt feelings. Use this hiccup as an opportunity to clarify expectations. The two of you might want different things out of this relationship, and it's best to know that earlier rather than later. Are you going to take things as they come, or is there a standing weekly date you have to schedule? You might not have as much room for them in your life as you think.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 13, 2020:</span> Your feelings are what they are. Own them and own up to them! Denying your emotions any longer will only delay the inevitable. Respect the way you feel and you'll teach others to do the same. Whatever hesitation you've been feeling about a relationship will disappear today when you get a message that sheds some much-needed light on the situation. What you have been worrying about isn't something you need to be worrying about. It's merely a minor setback.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 13, 2020:</span> Your actions could impress others today, although you might not completely understand why. Lately, you have been pleasing people and making a major impact without even trying, and this type of effect is going to continue for a few more days. Therefore, you should be mindful of the fact that your small actions can trigger big events. Watch how friendly you are with new people. They could misinterpret your behavior and presume you're flirting with them.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 13, 2020:</span> Draw on your compassion to deal with a friend who's feeling moody and low today. They've had a rough time, and even if your experiences differ, you have to be sympathetic about where they are in life. Walk around in their shoes for a few hours today. You'll soon see that if you had to deal with what they're dealing with, you'd pretty much be in the same type of mood. Bring more empathy back into your life. It will help you understand.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 13, 2020:</span> Although it's necessary to maintain a reputation for good manners and compassion, there is no law that says you can't stir things up once in a while. Start a controversial conversation today and watch the drama unfurl. Celebrate your rebellious side today and get something started! After all, anyone can sit quietly in the corner and take life as it comes. It takes guts to break out of your shell and go out into the unknown, forging your own path.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 13, 2020:</span> Stop wishing for things you don't have, and start working with what you do have. You don't have to accept things the way they are, but you do have to recognize that in order to change them, you have to do the work. Physically, your body can be changed, but you have to have patience and know that things can't happen overnight. Emotionally, the same holds true. Don't put pressure on yourself to change how you feel immediately. Give yourself time!</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 13, 2020:</span> Are you feeling claustrophobic? You might be tired of seeing the same people in the same places. You need to mix it up a bit! Dig out your contact list and relocate some friends you've let fade away. Give them a call and see what's up. They'll be glad to hear from you, whether make plans to get together in the future or not. When you take the time to connect with someone you normally wouldn't see, the extra effort is always worth it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 13, 2020:</span> A small change you made weeks ago has created a huge improvement in your life, and you'll start noticing the rewards of your efforts today. Very soon, you'll be able to kick back, put your feet up, and let someone else worry about things for a while. Being passive isn't a character flaw. It's an element of every balanced person's personality. Your quest for balance has been very successful, and this is one of the few final elements to incorporate into your life.</p>
