<p><span class="date">Mar 19, 2020:</span> Someone in your family may be going through a life change that causes you to look at yourself differently. Embrace the educational opportunities the experience offers, and try not to get too caught up in the emotion of it all. Your ties with your family have been looser than you may like, but they're tightening more and more as each day passes. Make a plan to get together and tell old embarrassing stories. Remind yourself how much fun it can be to laugh until you cry.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 19, 2020:</span> As enlightened as it may be to be open-minded and accepting of all different ways of doing things, at a certain point in any decision-making process, you have to pick one way and go with it. Do not fear that by choosing a route you are negating all the others. Today, narrow down your options, and keep in mind that there's no such thing as "right" or "wrong" in this instance. It's just a matter of figuring out what is right for you. People will respect your choice. They'll have to.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 19, 2020:</span> It's only natural that a past relationship would enter your mind as you embark upon a new one. The similarities and the contrasts are just as striking. But are you letting the past cast too heavy a shadow over your present? You have to see this person for who they are, not for who they aren't. Your role in a partnership is something you have to be willing to adjust right now. To keep things progressing, you might have to start being more forceful.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 19, 2020:</span> You could be making incredible progress in a business deal right now, but you'll have to be careful not to push things too far too fast. Not everyone is on the same page as you right now, and you must be aware of that. Plus, there is a bit of instability around you right now (it's nothing to be concerned about) that could put you off track for a few days if you aren't prudent in your actions. Spend and act modestly, and don't waste your energy.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 19, 2020:</span> No one else can give you confidence. It's something only you can give yourself. And you could get a great opportunity to do just that today! A past failure is waiting to be rectified, so when you get a chance for a do-over, grab it! Being able to fight back after a loss is something you can do with grace and fire, so why not give it a try? Once bitten, but never shy—that should be your motto! People take notice of those who don't let one mistake slow them down.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 19, 2020:</span> If closure is frustratingly slow in coming, stop waiting around for it. Things are settling down nicely enough to give you a firm foundation for moving forward, so feel free to go ahead. Lingering feelings of guilt, regret, or anger need to just settle inside you for a while. You can come back and deal with these feelings when you're ready. Keep things quiet, and don't put too much pressure on yourself to be happy all the time.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 19, 2020:</span> Reflections aren't only found in mirrors. Today, seeing your true self isn't really possible unless you take the time to be honest and accept your imperfections. Put away your ego and you'll be able to learn a valuable lesson about your insecurities. Don't forget: Family traits aren't written in stone. Who you are isn't predetermined, and you're a work in progress. You can make all the changes you want to make. You just have to start—and then keep going.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 19, 2020:</span> Just like you'd peel an avocado, trim the fat off a steak, or scrape old paint off a chair, you've got to work to get rid of the undesirable things in your life. Cut out what isn't working, what doesn't feel right, and what isn't flattering. This could include something as simple as a pair of old shoes or as complicated as a romantic partner who just doesn't have their heart in the relationship. Toss it to the curb and walk away without looking back!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 19, 2020:</span> Bravado can go quite a long way toward putting you in a very commanding situation right now, so don't be afraid to bluff a little. No one knows for sure which cards you're holding, so why shouldn't they feel a little intimidated by your awesomeness? Work the mystery to your advantage. Any power struggles aren't going to be a real challenge for you, because deep down you know that you have all the answers (or at least you should act like you do).</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 19, 2020:</span> Even though you may have your fingers in a million different pies, you'll find a way to put it all on hold if your friends need you today. Helping other people will help you. Seeing things from the perspective of someone who is in turmoil can help you take stock of what's going on in your life, too. This is a day for exchanging ideas in a safe, open environment. By the end of the day, the pace around you will match your mood: contemplative and quiet.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 19, 2020:</span> The way you respect other people's privacy is admirable, but it could be limiting your opportunities. Don't be afraid to talk to the people around you about getting what you want. They're there to help you get things started. Managing your finances is a task that's making its way back onto the agenda big time, and you could get some fresh ideas from some surprising sources.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 19, 2020:</span> When you're having fun, everything is painless, including sacrifice. Be careful if someone approaches you to make a business offer you can't refuse. You can refuse—and you should refuse. You're too smart to fall for any smooth talk, but you may still get quite a kick out of their song and dance routine. Poke holes in the pitch and watch them deflate. Being smarter than everyone else can be fun, no?</p>
