<p><span class="date">Apr 7, 2020:</span> Today, conflict could lead to some very rewarding and constructive exchanges. Of course, that doesn't mean you should go out looking for a fight, but it does mean that if someone causes a bit of friction in your life, they are someone you should spend a little more time with! Wouldn't it be boring if everyone agreed with everything you said? Celebrate the fact that people all have their own way of thinking about things.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 7, 2020:</span> Hold your fire today if someone bursts onto the scene and comes dangerously close to messing up something you've been working on for a very long time. You might want to rip their head off and tell them to get lost, but you have to tolerate their presence and listen to what they have to say whether you like it or not. This could be a politically delicate situation, and they have to have their say. Let them feel like they're doing something, and then continue down your planned path.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 7, 2020:</span> Feel like you've been on a roller-coaster ride over the past few days? If so, you're in for some welcome news. All signs point toward today being a very good day for you. It will be full of just enough new, exciting things and old, comforting things to keep you smiling. A nice surprise toward the afternoon will remind you of how much you're loved by the friends you've chosen to be in your life. You're on the right track, and you totally know it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 7, 2020:</span> If you feel like you're stuck at a crossroads today, remember your plans for the future in order to know exactly where you need to go. It's more important than ever for you to stick to your initial plans and not veer off into new projects or adventures that seem tantalizing. Put the blinders on if you have to, because you need to stay focused on what is ahead of you. Resist anyone's invitation to "try something a little bit different" today.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 7, 2020:</span> It's time to shift your focus and start dealing with the opposite end of the spectrum. If you're obsessed with celebrities and gossip websites, check out a news source and get informed about current issues. If you have no clue who the hottest celebs are right now, click around to a few gossip websites and enlighten yourself about who's marrying whom and whose divorce is final. Mix up your knowledge and you'll become even more interesting.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 7, 2020:</span> It might feel like there are too many overbearing people in your life right now. Everyone seems to know exactly what you should do next, and they aren't shy about telling you! These bossy bosses truly do have your best interests at heart, so try not to be too angry about their meddlesome ways. Just smile and thank them for their interest, but make it clear to them that you're in charge of your life, and, right or wrong, your decisions are the ones that will guide your life.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 7, 2020:</span> Talking about your hopes for the future with friends and family is a nice way to pass the day, but it does little to make actual changes happen in your life. It might be time to take a break and go off on your own for a while. Solitude can reignite your individualism and remind you that, ultimately, you're the only person who can take you where you want to go in life. Get back in touch with the things you (and only you) want for yourself. Start making them happen.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 7, 2020:</span> Today, you might have to watch yourself when you're exposed to your greatest temptation. If it's cookies or cake, you should preemptively fill up on vegetables so you won't weaken. If it's that certain someone who always gets your heart beating faster, you should get out of there as quickly as you can! You know what's bad for you, and you know you need to stay away from it right now. Do whatever you have to do get out of the danger zone and into the safe zone.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 7, 2020:</span> Are you hungry for a new adventure? Of course you are! There is so much in life to discover, and today is just as good as any other day to start exploring! Travel is a great idea, especially travel to a foreign country. Go online and start planning your next trip today. If you don't have the time or the finances for such an elaborate expedition, read a book about your dream destination, or try making some dishes from that cuisine. Feed your wanderlust with food.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 7, 2020:</span> It won't be easy to get alone time today. Your presence could be much in demand. If you're craving some solo hours, you could be facing a tough challenge. If you can, just give in and get together with the people who are clamoring for your attention. There will be plenty of time in the coming days to go off on your own and think or relax. For now, you will need to try to find happiness in the energy generated when you're the center of attention.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 7, 2020:</span> It might not feel good to give up some of what you want today, but a compromise is called for. It could be something as minor as fixing a different meal because of someone's dietary preferences, or it could be something as major as altering your entire schedule to make things easier on someone else. Propose that things go their way this time and your way next time. You don't have to roll over and let them walk all over you, but you could give a little bit more.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 7, 2020:</span> You have a lot of ideas about where you want your career to go from here, and today, one of those ideas could come one giant step closer to becoming reality. The work you've been putting into things is going to pay off very soon, but you should still give it some nudges here and there. Ask a few penetrating questions, and you'll love what you hear. The effort you make today can yield exciting results, so be ready to respond at a moment's notice.</p>
