<p><span class="date">Mar 27, 2020:</span> Try not to get involved in anything confusing today. It's only going to lead to frustration. This isn't a great day for learning new tasks or starting new projects. Your mind won't be able to focus on adapting to new methods or ideas. If you feel that you're unclear about something, get clarity immediately. Ask someone in the know what the real deal is, and don't be worried about looking like you don't know what you're doing. Your pride shouldn't enter into it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 27, 2020:</span> You're finally coming to a deeper understanding of a task that has been particularly challenging for you. You're getting a handle on things and feeling more empowered about what you need to do. This could be a wonderful day for you—your power is growing and it feels good. You're starting to think that you could pretty much overcome any obstacle that comes your way. And you know what? You're absolutely right.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 27, 2020:</span> The idea of making some big changes in your life is very appealing to you, possibly even including making a career change. But be careful not to assume that a new job will equal a new life. There's much more to it than that. A different daily monotony is still a daily monotony, no matter what the new title may be. It's important to add a healthy dose of reality in with all of your wishful thinking and fantasizing. Give this idea a bit more thought before acting on it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 27, 2020:</span> Take some time to be grateful about where you are. You have so much good energy around you, and you know that hasn't always been the case. There will always be some tough times, but it's a wonderful day to take a deep breath and relax! Take stock and do a mental inventory of the people who leave you feeling energized and good about yourself, as well as the people who leave you feeling drained. Moving forward, make sure you choose to spend more time with positive influences.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 27, 2020:</span> There are always consequences to your actions, but today they might be the kind that you can't predict, so make sure you listen very closely to what other people say. They'll give you all the clues you need to guess how the group will react once you announce your big decision. If you fear their reaction, it doesn't mean you should change your mind. It just means you should be prepared to explain yourself. They won't take a simple "because I said so" for an answer.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 27, 2020:</span> You might be moving too quickly for others today. Your brain is firing on all cylinders, and not everyone is going to be able to keep up! But don't give it a second thought. Let other people go at the pace that feels most comfortable to them. You can't adjust your timetable to suit the needs of others, and moving on without them won't create any tensions at all. It's a time of every person for themself, when you just have to do what you have to do.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 27, 2020:</span> Every goal you set for yourself doesn't have to be a big one. Who are you trying to impress? Everyone who needs to think you're a rock star already thinks it, so take a breather and just relax. Set a few smaller goals instead of one big one. And don't get upset if things don't progress at all. You're not in a race, no matter how much you'd like to be the first one finished. Focus your energy on smaller tasks that need to be done.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 27, 2020:</span> Step out of reality when you have a chance, and check in with your fantasy life! It's been stuck on pause for far too long. You need to get back in there and fill in some blanks. Dream about where you'll be in ten years, fantasize about who you'll be with and what you'll be doing. There's no harm in having the line between reality and fantasy blurred right now. In fact, it will make your reality all the more clear. Daydreaming can help your day go by quickly.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 27, 2020:</span> Are you afraid of hearing something you don't want to hear? Or confused about what you'll do if you hear what you want to hear? Waiting for news can be excruciating, but there is no getting around it. To distract yourself in the meantime, get in touch with someone who's been through what you're going through. Ask them about their experience and listen to them reminisce. Not only will it help the time go faster, but you will learn a lot that you can apply to your life in the future.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 27, 2020:</span> Getting too much attention could be dangerous for you right now. You aren't quite ready for a high level of scrutiny, so beg off making any major presentations today. There is no need to do anything before you're ready, and no one will be pushing you. Don't try to be a star before you've got the material you need to back it up! Hang back and wait until you know you're ready for prime time. If you want to advance a project, just work on it some more.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 27, 2020:</span> If you're being pulled and pushed back and forth by two different people right now, you have to get out of the middle of it! These other people have their own issues, and they need to deal with them without you. You don't need the stress, and you certainly don't deserve the responsibility of fixing something that you didn't break. Let them know to count you out of the fight today, and keep yourself busy making some headway on your chores or work goals.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 27, 2020:</span> As much as you'd like, you simply can't be friends with everyone, so why even try? It's not that you should write certain people off or start being rude to people who don't fawn all over you. But you should stop wasting your energy trying to charm someone who just doesn't seem to get where you're coming from. Instead, put your energy toward the people who deserve your time and who give you back the kindness and respect you give to them.</p>
