<p><strong>Feb 21, 2020</strong> - If you've got something you're trying to study, Aries, this isn’t the day to do it. Your concentration is likely to be off, and what you're reading will probably look like Greek to you. Unless it’s really necessary, it would be best to put the books aside until tomorrow, since you probably won't absorb much today. Trying to read could give rise to the illusion that you've learned something. Be on the safe side and put it off!</p>

<h1>Taurus Horoscope</h1>

<p><strong>Feb 21, 2020</strong> - Dark, depressing dreams could plague your sleep tonight, Taurus, probably alternating with silly ones that make you laugh out loud. You could wake in the morning totally confused by these images, and your tendency might be to dismiss them. Don't do this. Your dreams are trying to tell you something about yourself. Have you had your emotional ups and downs lately? Have you alternately laughed and cried over something? Think about it!</p>

<h1>Gemini Horoscope</h1>

<p><strong>Feb 21, 2020</strong> - Have you been invited to a party that's supposed to take place today? If you think you haven't, Gemini, you'd better check your calendar again. All signs suggest that you could forget a lot of important things right now and one might be a social event, perhaps business related. This might not be one of your best days. Usually you tend to have a memory like an elephant. Just for the time being, keep your calendar handy!</p>

<h1>Cancer Horoscope</h1>

<p><strong>Feb 21, 2020</strong> - Too much mental or physical exercise could have you feeling a bit burned out today, Cancer. You could be considerably slower on the uptake than usual, and those around you could be surprised that you, normally very energetic, seem to be moving like a snail. Spend as much time resting as you can, because you'll need to recoup your stamina. If you must work, concentrate on routine tasks requiring very little conscious effort.</p>

<h1>Leo Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=5


<p><strong>Feb 21, 2020</strong> - Although your partner may be feeling very sensual at this time, Leo, you might not feel much like getting passionate. You've had a stressful few days and can barely move, so your response to sexual overtures is apt to be lukewarm at best. Your affection certainly hasn't diminished, but your partner could interpret your behavior that way. Whatever you decide to do, make sure your friend knows exactly how you feel and why you feel that way.</p>

<h1>Virgo Horoscope</h1>

<p><strong>Feb 21, 2020</strong> - Your home could be a gloomy place today, Virgo. A member of the household is likely to be away, and this person's presence is apt to be very sorely missed. The only thing you can do under the circumstances is make sure everyone keeps busy until the absent one returns. One way to distract the family is to get them to clean up the house in anticipation of a warm welcome!</p>

<h1>Libra Horoscope</h1>

<p><strong>Feb 21, 2020</strong> - An older relative or neighbor may need your assistance today, Libra. This is apt to be a very inconvenient time for someone to ask for help, because you have plenty of chores of your own. Nonetheless, you'll go to the rescue because that's your nature. Take care to plan your time carefully, pace yourself, and try not to do too much at once. That way you'll live to help again tomorrow.</p>


8:
<h1>Scorpio Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=8


<p><strong>Feb 21, 2020</strong> - Your creative talents could seem totally blocked today, Scorpio. You may have a project you really want to work on. You have the mental focus, but the creative element just might not be there. This could prove so frustrating that you want to throw something. Do this if you must (preferably a pillow). Still, the only answer might be to shelve your work until tomorrow. You should be back to normal by then.</p>


9:
<h1>Sagittarius Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=9


<p><strong>Feb 21, 2020</strong> - This definitely isn’t a good day to stay home and do household chores, Sagittarius. If you do, some sad and rather irrational thoughts may plague you throughout the day. No matter what the weather's like, it would be far better to get out and do anything that keeps your mind focused on something positive. Go shopping, attend a sports event, see a movie, or visit a friend. Whatever you do, get your mind off yourself. Go enjoy your day.</p>

<h1>Capricorn Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=10


<p><strong>Feb 21, 2020</strong> - Some disappointing news could put you into a rather gloomy state at some point today, Capricorn. Someone close to you might suddenly have to leave town for several weeks and you'll be lonely without them. There isn’t much point in dwelling on this, however. You'll just have to stay in touch via phone or email and look forward to the time when your friend comes back. You should be pretty busy during those days, anyway!</p>

<h1>Aquarius Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=11


<p><strong>Feb 21, 2020</strong> - The fundraising activities of a group with which you're affiliated are going very well, Aquarius, but today you're likely to find that things seem to be stalled. Checks may not come in the mail, important people don't return your phone calls, or someone doesn't show up to do the job at hand. This situation is frustrating, but it probably won't last beyond today. By tomorrow you should all be your busy selves again. Hang in there!</p>


12:
<h1>Pisces Horoscope</h1>
https://horoscope.com/us/horoscopes/general/horoscope-general-daily-today.aspx?sign=12


<p><strong>Feb 21, 2020</strong> - Career matters could move so slowly today that you just might be tempted to give up, Pisces. Don't even think that way! It's just one of those days when nothing seems to go right, even though basically everything should still be going very well for you. Don't expect much progress today, and certainly don't expect anything but gloom from colleagues. Put a calendar with cartoons on the wall so you can distract yourself with some laughs throughout the day.</p>
