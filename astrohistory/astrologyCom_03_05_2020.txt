<p><span class="date">Mar 5, 2020:</span> This morning, what seems like an innocent conversation to you might have an entirely different connotation for one of the other people involved. You have to acknowledge that your words could have more than one meaning. There's nothing you can do to stop someone from reading you the wrong way right now, but there is a lot you can do if a misunderstanding occurs. As soon as you get an inkling that someone has the wrong idea, you have to talk to them about it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 5, 2020:</span> Why are you trying to be everyone's friend? It's admirable that you want all people to like you, but it's simply impractical. Sometimes people get on your nerves, and sometimes (believe it or not) you get on theirs. It's not the end of the world. Conflicts, arguments, and tension don't mean the end of a relationship. You need to start rolling with the punches and understand that sometimes going through rough patches makes you appreciate the smooth road all the more.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 5, 2020:</span> Boy, people sure know how to get to you, don't they? One little sob story and you're ready to do whatever it takes to put a smile on their face again! It's wonderful that you're so compassionate and kind, but don't you think that sometimes you might be getting played? If someone tries to win you over to their side by playing on your emotions today, ask them for facts and figures to back it up. Get a little bit more skeptical and you'll start going a lot further.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 5, 2020:</span> You're getting in the mood to socialize, and it's perfect timing. Most of your favorite people are in the mood to socialize, too! This is a fantastic time to throw a little dinner party or invite a bunch of your pals over for a cookout. Whichever you decide to do, make it a potluck. When everyone contributes something to the event, then everyone feels like they're a part of something special. Get ready for some good laughs and a few surprises.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 5, 2020:</span> Being honest is the hardest thing to do sometimes, but it's the very best thing you can do for your most turbulent relationship. You have to remove your ego from the situation and let yourself be vulnerable and honest about what you feel. Telling someone what you think they want to hear isn't going to help the two of you move forward in any healthy or positive way. Spill your guts in whatever way you can, but make sure you don't hold anything back. They can take it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 5, 2020:</span> Today, the universe could be sending a few unusual people into your life. These folks might confuse and distract you, but most importantly they'll entertain you. Just get these people talking about their philosophies of life and love and you'll be enthralled. They don't think like you, they don't look like you, and they most certainly don't act like you. That's why you can learn so much from them. Expect at least one of your long-held beliefs to change.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 5, 2020:</span> You need a stimulating dose of creativity and cultural ideas today, so why not check out a new exhibit at an art museum? Spend some time listening to different randomly generated music selections online and see if you find a new musician you'd like to listen to more. Or visit an ethnic restaurant you've never been to before. Stepping outside your normal routine is a powerful way to remind yourself that your life is a path you choose to take. You're in control. You can change things up whenever you want.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 5, 2020:</span> You may have just won an amazing victory, but try not to celebrate too loudly or too long about it. You have to be careful not to irritate people whose help you may need in the very near future. You've earned the position you're in right now, and you deserve to be proud of yourself. But bigger things are at stake than your ego right now. If you want to avoid conflict, you need to avoid bragging about how wonderful you are. The people who need to know how special you are already know it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 5, 2020:</span> Your objectivity will be incredibly valuable today, so use it liberally. Not only will it help you sort through the many choices in front of you, but it will also help you avoid getting involved in petty arguments between petty people. Let your emotions, alliances, and fears take a back seat right now. Just let your brain look at things more analytically. Once you do, you'll see that not everything someone told you was the truth.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 5, 2020:</span> Thoughts about family could be at the forefront of your mindâ€”either starting a new one or keeping in closer contact with the one you have. If you feel like your career is taking over too much of your free time, today is the day to talk to someone about it. And don't just complain about it to your friends or co-workers. Make an appointment with the person who can really make the changes that you need. Stand up for yourself. You're not asking for more than you deserve.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 5, 2020:</span> If you hang out with unenthusiastic people today, you're definitely going to be bored. Too much of today's energy relies on the people you surround yourself with, so try to find the peppiest people possible! Don't worry. Your connections are vast, and your creativity is hot. There won't be any trouble hooking up with a group of folks who know how to keep things lively and keep you smiling! Save the somber stuff for some other time. Today should be all about happy stuff.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 5, 2020:</span> Your creative juices are flowing fast and furious today, and they'll help you see beauty nearly everywhere you look. The symmetry of an office cubicle suddenly strikes you as poetic, the glare of traffic headlights seem to twinkle in time with the music you're listening to. What you saw as visual noise now becomes a beautiful symphony. Don't take this special kind of insight for granted. Tune in to it. It will lead you to a wonderful and exciting new idea.</p>
