<p><span class="date">Mar 2, 2020:</span> Your ambition has a lot of control over you right now, but it could be forcing you to take on more than you can really handle. Be mindful of how full your plate is. There's no point in taking on any more projects if you don't have the energy to deal with them. You'll only get frustrated and build up a reputation for being flaky or unreliable, and that isn't who you really are. Let some stuff pass you by today. Someone needs the experiences more than you do.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 2, 2020:</span> It's time today to add a little breathing room to your schedule! You've been in a hurry lately, getting things done left and right. Your productivity is admirable, but it can't be sustained. Go slowly today, and if you can put a few things off for another day, do it. Call that friend and reschedule your dinner date. Let them know you need a quiet night in. They'll not only be able to relate, but they'll probably be grateful for the chance to have one, too!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 2, 2020:</span> Let all of your fantasies, hopes, and wishes guide you on your path today, not your responsibilities, fears, or guilt. You don't have to schedule your life around anyone else if you don't want to right now, and you most certainly don't have to do anything you don't want to! Most importantly, you can't avoid something just because it makes you a little bit scared. In fact, if something intimidates you, that means you should definitely tackle and conquer it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 2, 2020:</span> The little bit of drama that you could have early today would catch a normal person off guard and ruin their entire day, but not you! Your quick mind will help you figure out a great solution in no time, and you'll be able to make everybody happy. You'll salvage a great day out of a messy morning. You're becoming a wonderful peacemaker right now, and you should get used to being the person that your friends and family turn to when they need some insight or advice.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 2, 2020:</span> In any type of conflict you may have today, try to focus on the facts and figures of the situation at hand, not the emotions they're stirring up. You can't always think about things in terms of how they make you feel. Right now, you just need to think. Turn off your heart, turn up your brainpower, and an answer will become obvious almost immediately. You're smarter than you give yourself credit for, and you should start trusting your brain just as much as you trust your gut.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 2, 2020:</span> If you're feeling combative early in the day, don't assume that this feeling will last the entire day. You can mellow out easily as long as you give in a little. Agree to a compromise and you'll stop feeling the need to fight. Sure, maybe a friend's lunch suggestion is at your least favorite restaurant, but you can find something to eat on the menu. You can't have everything you want all the time. If you did, you'd miss out on some neat new stuff!</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 2, 2020:</span> One of your personal relationships could be growing into a business relationship, and this is a very good thing for both of you. You each have your head on straight, and the communication is healthy enough between the two of you to enable you to take care of work as well as of each other. This is a day of great potential for both of you. It's time to move forward with your plans and see what happens. The two of you will be there for each other every step of the way.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 2, 2020:</span> Things are looking good for you today if you're trying to start anything like a new job, a trip, some sort of art project, or a fitness routine. Just make sure you don't put too much pressure on yourself. Don't expect instant results. It's important to enjoy the early stage of this and get used to the feeling it brings to your life. The beginning stage of anything is full of uncertainty, so it's helpful to be comfortable with not knowing exactly what's going to happen next.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 2, 2020:</span> The world is full of opportunities for you to grow today, so try to free up some time in the afternoon to take advantage of at least one of them! Plus, your brain is open to new ideas and new ways of doing things, and you're one old dog who is ready to learn some new tricks. If you've been thinking about starting a new hobby, pursuing a new interest, or making a big move toward a new relationship, this is the right day to get things going. Making a change has never felt so exciting.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 2, 2020:</span> Now is not the time to go on a shopping spree or be otherwise careless with your money. You have two opposites working against each other: your sense of responsibility and your urge to shower those you love with gifts. Listen to your more practical side and understand that your friends would rather have you pinching pennies and free of stress than worried about what bills you're going to pay first! You can be generous with your time instead. They will appreciate it much more.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 2, 2020:</span> When opportunity knocks, you don't always have to open the door. Be careful not to become a person who always says yes because you think being always busy is a good way to be. It's time to get a lot more particular about what you get involved with. You don't have the time, energy, or resources to hop on every bandwagon that comes your way. Think about your goals and how to get there. This will free you up to truly understand which opportunities to take and which to leave.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 2, 2020:</span> You'll have the answer to a problem that has been puzzling people for quite a while, and you'll have it faster than anyone else around! You're going to shine today, and everyone will be unanimous in their praise of you. Don't start blushing when people go on and on about how smart and helpful you are. Just soak it in! This is the start of a very positive phase for you and your people. Everyone's put their drama behind them, and they're ready to just relax and have fun.</p>
