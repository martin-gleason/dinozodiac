<p><span class="date">Mar 6, 2020:</span> Mixing finances with friendship is seldom a good idea, and that goes double for today! One of your most beloved people needs some money, but, unfortunately, they don't always know how to handle it responsibly. If you lend them some out of kindness, you'll probably be tense about when and how they'll pay you back, which will only create tension. Unless you're able to give it to them as a gift outright, don't give them anything. It's just not worth it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 6, 2020:</span> This morning, take a good, long look in the mirror and remind yourself that you definitely have your fair share of sex appeal! Having a healthy level of confidence is more attractive than wearing a certain size, having a certain hairstyle, or driving a certain car. Strut your stuff. The magnetic energy you exude when you believe in yourself is undeniable. Admit you're hot and act like it! You'll start reeling in the cuties.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 6, 2020:</span> Just because someone rejects one of your ideas doesn't mean that it's a bad idea. You need to consider the fact that your audience simply isn't smart enough to comprehend your brilliance! Move on to another person or group of people and see what they think of your proposal. And if they also don't like it, guess what you should do? Go on to someone else. Try your ideas on them! In other words, if you know you've got something good going, keep on going with it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 6, 2020:</span> You have a lot of good things to say about a current issue that's been brewing in your social circle, and the people around you are going to be more receptive to hearing them than they might have been in the past. Disagreements or differences of opinion aren't going to get anyone too hot under the collar right now, so it's the perfect time to tackle a touchy subject and put it to rest once and for all. This is the start of a very peaceful time.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 6, 2020:</span> Your feelings are definitely important to get a handle on, but you can't spend all your time in introspection. There are things you need to do, and you can't waste time figuring out what's in your heart right now. Whatever is in there isn't going anywhere, so don't worry. When you have time to deal with it, it will be there waiting for you. Focus on what you need to get done today and just do it. Finish any unfinished work. People are waiting.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 6, 2020:</span> Any shocking news you get early today is only part of the story, so don't fly off the handle right away. There is more you need to know, and you might have to wait a while to get the rest of the pieces of this particular puzzle. Over the next few days you'll start to learn more about what's really going on. Until then, making any assumptions will only lead to problems bigger than you can solve on your own. This situation could turn out to be a very anticlimactic one.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 6, 2020:</span> Keep your sense of humor in check today. Don't be hurtful just for the sake of a laugh. Right now, your energy is a bit uncontrollable, and if you get too carried away with the jokes and antics, you could easily step a little too far outside the boundaries of acceptable behavior. Sticking your foot in your mouth is never pleasant, but you can avoid it if you just stay aware of your surroundings. Show respect for the places you'll be in, and take care of your reputation.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 6, 2020:</span> Right now, you should try to be even more open about your life than you normally are. By letting other people know what you're up to, you'll make them feel more important. One of your friends has been feeling a little neglected, and while the they choose to communicate that fact to you isn't very mature, you're getting the message. It's time to open up and let them know why you may have been avoiding them. It's for the health of your relationship.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 6, 2020:</span> Communication is about more than talking or even writing. How is your body language-reading skill these days? Nonverbal cues are going to be much more important than verbal ones today, so keep your ears shut and your eyes open! Be on the lookout for people with folded arms who claim to be open, or smiling faces with angry eyes. You'll have more insight into what's going on if you pay attention to what people are not saying as well as what they're saying.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 6, 2020:</span> You need a few new dreams! Today, you should switch mental gears and start spending more energy thinking about positive thinking. Visualize the brightest future you can possibly imagine—the job you want, the person you want, and the life you want! And don't you dare waste time worrying about whether you'll fall short or fail. It's important to keep your focus on the bright side. News is coming that might come as a pleasant shock.</p>

<p><span class="date">Mar 6, 2020:</span> You've always been a good listener, but today your skill as a shoulder to cry on will be put to the test. A sad friend is yet again calling for your advice, and this time you might not be in the mood to give it to them. They never seem to take any of it anyway, right? Nevertheless, you need to give them as much time as you can afford, preferably in person. By helping them process their feelings, you'll be building your communication skills and showing them you're a good friend.</p>
