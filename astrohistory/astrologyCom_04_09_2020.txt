<p><span class="date">Apr 9, 2020:</span> Your resources could be a bit pinched. Either you don't have enough money, or you don't have enough time to get your latest goal accomplished. But have no fear! It's time to bring out your secret weapon: your breathtaking ingenuity. Apply some creativity to whatever's got you flummoxed, and soon you'll be humming along on the right track again. Your quick thinking will gain you a new fan, too, and it might even ignite a few romantic sparks.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 9, 2020:</span> You have some valuable insight that a friend could use right now, so make yourself available in case someone needs to bend your ear. What you've experienced (and learned from) can help them get out of any rut they're stuck in. Whether it involves a romantic situation or a job, you can help. Try not to lose sight of the fact that all your conversations with this person have to be constructive.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 9, 2020:</span> Feed yourself well today—physically, mentally, and emotionally. Don't skimp on breakfast by having coffee and a donut. Sit down and enjoy a real, nutritious meal. You'll need all the fuel you can get to continue with your busy day. Next, feed your mind. You are more intellectually curious right now than you have been in a while, and there are mysteries you've been pondering for a long time. Today is the day to solve them.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 9, 2020:</span> You definitely know how to create a good time for everyone around you, but today you deserve to take a break from your "social director" duties. Turn the plans over to someone else, and make sure you put yourself in the hands of someone who does things differently than you. Take a risk and trust that they know what to do. This is a great opportunity to explore something new and try something you might never have tried before.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 9, 2020:</span> It's only natural for you to want to avoid getting into a fight today, but that might not be possible. Don't fret too much about it. After all, disagreements aren't always a bad thing. The heat of an argument can often help forge the truth. Sure, it might be initially unpleasant to struggle through sensitive topics and truths so raw that they hurt, but in the end you and your sparring partner will be better off. Closeness can come from conflict.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 9, 2020:</span> There is much to be learned from conflict and trial. After all, it's very high pressure that produces diamonds, right? It might not please you to look ahead and see some drama, but after this day is over you'll be a better person for it. Not every day can be a breeze, and going through a rough patch will make you all the more appreciative when you encounter calm waters once again. Ride out the problems and it will be smooth sailing sooner than you think.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 9, 2020:</span> Sometimes, no matter how fervently you wish or how hard you push, things are not going to go the way you want. Although you won't have all your hopes dashed, a bracing dose of reality will remind you that there are many things beyond your control. Most importantly, don't take this as a sign you're losing power. Rather, take it as a fact that life would be pretty boring if you always got what you wanted. Seek out the company of people who understand this.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 9, 2020:</span> An odd but powerful surge of childhood energy could be present throughout the day, and it could affect you or the people around you. Be prepared for some adult-size tantrums and silly pouting. Someone you know quite well is going to get very moody if they don't get what they want—will it be you? Revisiting your past childish techniques won't get you very far today, but it might be kind of fun. Try to just go with the flow and not take anything too seriously.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 9, 2020:</span> Today, you'll have all the intensity you need to stay focused on a very tricky situation. While other people might not know how to approach things, you'll have such clarity of thought that the path will be crystal clear. Let everyone else know that they should follow your lead if they want to find the answer. Although the outcome is still uncertain, the stars say that you can easily turn things in a favorable direction if a project starts to go south.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 9, 2020:</span> Load up on carbohydrates early, because today could be quite a marathon! Not only will you be juggling lots of different tasks at once, but you will also have to deal with all the demanding people who contact you with advice, requests, and questions. No one will have the patience to wait, so you'll have to be firm when you tell them to take their place in line. Prioritization is the only way to get through such a busy day.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 9, 2020:</span> Your personal time is somewhat fluid right now, but if you're going to spend most of the day in contact with a group, time will be a lot tighter. A lot of people are going to be more interested in voicing their opinions and hearing the sound of their own voice than in working collaboratively and making compromises. Put on your efficiency hat and try to be the voice of reason. Whip these folks into shape and remind everyone that there's no point in taking things personally.</p>

<p><span class="date">Apr 9, 2020:</span> You have a calling, and signs are emerging around you that reinforce that fact. People are giving you feedback that is genuine. They're not just praising you for their health! Have faith in yourself and understand that you're capable of amazing things. The worst mistake you could make today is to limit yourself. This applies to new relationships, career challenges, and even business opportunities. Act on your ideas and climb out of your shell.</p>
