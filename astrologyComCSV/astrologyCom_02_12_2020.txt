<p><span class="date">Feb 12, 2020:</span> Try to fit more physical activity into today. Take the stairs, park at the far end of the lot, or maybe just dance around the kitchen. Getting your blood pumping will serve as a great outlet for all the energy that you don't know what to do with. Getting active with your body also encourages you to get active in your brain. And who knows? That extra half an hour in your workout could stir up a bevy of new ideas and give you a strong sense of possibility.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 12, 2020:</span> Sophisticated language can be a veil hiding what you truly mean but are too afraid to say. But fancy talk can also be a tool to help folks understand what exactly it is that you mean at a high level. Which way you choose to use your stunning vocabulary is up to you, but it would be a shame to waste all your verbal skills by encouraging miscommunication. Camouflage is not your object. Don't be afraid to speak the truth, and don't cater to the lowest common denominator.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 12, 2020:</span> Being by yourself isn't going to be your idea of fun right now. The solo life is fun and rewarding at times, but not now. Today, you want action, lots of people, and definitely lots of noise. It's the perfect day for a rock concert, parade, festival, or any other kind of event that's jam-packed with excitement and activity. Your mind is eager for chaos, in part because it's freeing, and in part because you'll enjoy trying to organize it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 12, 2020:</span> New inventions and "just so crazy it could work" ideas could enter your mind throughout the day, sparking your attitude and making you feel empowered. Suddenly, the world is full of opportunity and inspiration! This is a great time to take a risk in the romance department and be a little bit more assertive about flirting. Take any opportunity you can get to come right out and let this person know you're into them. It will be nothing but flattering.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 12, 2020:</span> It looks like one of your frostier relationships is finally starting to warm up a bit. This person is a very sensitive soul, and all this time they were just trying to figure you out before admitting that they like you as much as everyone else does! You've won them over for now, but that doesn't mean you're the leader in this partnership. They have some amazing things to teach you, so realizing that the two of you are equals is very important.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 12, 2020:</span> When you look in your wallet, do you see neatly organized currency and credit cards, or do you see a mishmash of scraps of paper, crumbled up bills, and random phone numbers? If it's the latter, it's time to get organized! Your financial life has little chance of being calm and healthy if you don't respect your money. Taking extra time to organize it sends a message of respect out to the universe. If you treat your money like garbage, you won't ever get much value out if it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 12, 2020:</span> Achieving perfect harmony in life is next to impossible, but you need to make the effort today. Pay attention to your must-haves in life and fight for them! You must have respect, you must have freedom, and you must have affection. Finding all three in one place is tough but entirely possible. Evaluate your current situation and ask for what you're missing. An uncomfortable sacrifice may be required, but in the end you'll thank yourself for fighting for what you believe in: yourself.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 12, 2020:</span> In pursuing your constant quest for fairness in life, you have quite possibly overlooked the fact that sometimes there is simply a right way and a wrong way. You are to be commended for trying to see things from all different angles and having empathy for the motivations of unpopular people, but right now these behaviors are throwing important things out of balance. It's time to stop hearing all sides of the story. Just pick one and go with it.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 12, 2020:</span> Putting things in the right order is very important today. If you get out of whack, you'll get discouraged quickly. Remember that putting on your socks goes before putting on your shoes, and taking time to listen to all the instructions goes before acting. You may think you know best right now (because you usually do), but you don't. Defer to the directions and advice of people who have more experience in the current situation.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 12, 2020:</span> There are many shifts going on amid your relationships at work, home, or school. Luckily, these shifts are creating mostly good results. People who have been fighting are finally settling their differences, due in part to your level-headed encouragement and negotiation. Everybody's facing in the same positive direction again. You could be surrounded by a lot more goodwill today than you have been of late. It'll help the day go by quickly and joyfully.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 12, 2020:</span> You clean your kitchen when it gets messy, you clean your car when the back seat gets cluttered, and you should clean your mind when it gets filled with a bunch of negative things. This isn't a question of ignoring the real problems you may be mulling over; it's a question of letting go of worry. There are things you just can't do anything about. Those are the things you have to stop thinking about. Move on with good thoughts and leave the old, bad ones behind.</p>

<p><span class="date">Feb 12, 2020:</span> Some people try to distract themselves from problems at home by immersing themselves in work or school. But that tactic is a poor one since it only delays the inevitable. Don't make the mistake of pretending something doesn't exist when it does. Sooner or later reality will come knocking on your door and you'll have to deal with it. Face things head-on and you'll see how they're less scary than you thought. Denial makes things worse than they really are.</p>
